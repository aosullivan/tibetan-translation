live we are clicking the button as soon as possible oh yes oh yes oh yes oh yes guys welcome to another episode and as
0:06
you can see right now crypto is in a bit of a panic you don't really see it if you look at the Bitcoin price because
0:12
the Bitcoin price is the same as it was last week I mean it's 96 97 95 93 is the
Markets Red
0:19
same the market is consolidating but if you go on Twitter and if you see what's
0:24
happening there it's full on Panic we do see full on Panic happening a lot of it
0:30
has to do with the fact that we did see the Libra scam the Libra rug pool this
0:35
is a coin which is basically promoted by the president of Argentina and he
0:41
promoted Libra on Friday then it pumped all the way to 4.4 billion dollar in
Milei üá¶üá∑ coin dumped
0:47
market cap then it collapsed 95% and then melee removed the tweet and
0:54
he said that hey actually I I wasn't part of it I wasn't TR involved and listen I personally don't think that he
0:59
was was part of it but many people got wrecked many many people got wrecked it's crazy now I personally view it like
1:07
this you know if you are a baboon if you are a big baboon and you form all into
1:12
Libra I mean it's a bit of of Darwinism it's a bit of Darwinism and it seems that this is what happened there are a
1:19
lot of people that went so heavy into Libra it's crazy like it's crazy it's crazy you did you did also see Dave
1:28
pornoy invest five million dollar into it Dave port invested $5 million and
1:33
lost it but then he got refunded from the guy who is behind the coin and this is the most interesting thing that
1:39
actually I don't think that mle wanted to rug like he didn't make any money and he is under trial now he's going to be
It was all a trap for Milei?
1:46
on an impeachment trial okay this is this is turning out very bad for mle some people say that this is a setup
1:53
Marty party coming out saying that Libra was a political setup using an Argentinian law to try to impeach m
2:00
all the scam rhetoric is vanilla fuel for his opposition that probably set him up this I think is very very very likely
2:08
there are some different interests that are that are aligning here that number one they wanted to remove mle because he
2:14
is doing everything correctly for Argentina the voke Mind mind virus guys don't like him the Socialists don't like
2:19
him they want to get back into the socialistic era where everything is spent crazily you have inflation you
2:25
have all that so obviously they don't want M just like many people in the US don't want Trump that's number one but
2:31
number two there's also a big interest to make money from melee like from his name and this is where this guy comes
2:38
into picture this guy what's his name Hayden Mark Davis he's the CEO of this
Kelsier Ventures ü¶π‚ôÇÔ∏è behind Libra?
2:45
keler Ventures uh these guys they basically launched the coin I mean my impression is that they launch the coin
2:52
because Jupiter which is the Dex aggregator on Solana they did a tweet
2:57
where they said that this guy like this Kai Ventures how the hell you pronounce it they contacted Jupiter like weeks in
3:04
advance listen here they were basically contacted two weeks ago directly from
3:09
keler Ventures okay so this guy he knew like weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks
3:15
and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks in advance that there is going to be a melee Co coin a melee token and
3:21
that is going to launch and he pumped the crap out of it he also rugged the crap out of it I mean there is a lot of
3:28
crazy stuff coming out now okay so basically what did he do he was
3:33
probably part of the launch we don't know all all the details like it's all coming out now but what he did was that he sniped he sniped the hell out of the
3:41
coin and then he said listen I'm kind of part of the team so we sniped which means by the way when you snipe it means
3:47
that when the coin launches you know the contract address of the coin you can buy a lot of coins in the first block before
3:54
everyone starts raising and so instead of just Distributing the coins to the team having like Insider allocations you
4:00
can say we don't have any of that but instead you can snipe in the first block and you can buy the coins from the
4:06
market at basically you know zero dollars like super cheap that's what's called sniping and so it's crazy because
4:12
Koffee Zilla was interviewing him and he said basically we sniped so others could not snipe listen to this listen to this
Coffeezilla Exposing Scammers
4:20
so but if you but if you launch the coin isn't it unfair for you to snipe the coin so I would say no and I and I I
4:28
would say that for a couple different reasons number one a lot of the times when and again this is like I mean again
4:35
it's a much larger conversation uh which is what I told you in text but um most of the time when
4:41
worse a I have lots of I have I have different money in different places obviously um but from the standpoint of
4:49
sniping most of the time when we're sniping we're attempting to avoid other
4:56
snipers getting in right so whether that's I love it love this basically know we're
5:03
scamming so others can can scam now to be fair to be fair it is a bit of a
5:08
common thing to do like it to be fully fully fair if you look at the gami launch you can go and you can search
5:15
like gami sniper a crypto banter like running those guys they had to explain the same thing like they sniped but then
5:21
they said oh we're you know we're just for we're like we're sniping so you don't snipe okay and then they say we're
5:26
going to use the money for the project this and that so I mean to be fully fair to this Hayden guy he is not the first
5:33
one that says it like there there have been different coins that said that we snipe so you don't snipe okay and we're
5:38
not going to take the funds of course no no the funds that we take we're going to use them for project it's it's crazy now
5:46
so he sniped he he has now 100 million bucks okay because I think he also
5:52
dumped them like still the timeline is not fully clear but someone dumped 84 million around 100 million I I guess
5:58
it's him because he also says now you know I have a 100 million bucks I don't know what to do with it this is the money from sniping this
6:06
is the money from sniping listen to this like it's not a rug it's a plan gone miserably wrong with $100 million
6:12
sitting in account that I'm the custodian of but I'm not I I don't I'm I would love instruction on what to do
6:18
with it I don't want I don't have no desire to be Public Enemy Number One of how to make this happen I'm not
6:25
benefiting from this like it's not a rug yeah l $100 million in my in my wallet
6:32
let's see how we do with it I don't know what to do maybe you have some instruction what should we do with it you know what happens next time passes
6:39
like people forget you still have hundred million dollars in your wallet you know there's a new rug you know in crypto like crypto it's probably one of
6:46
the best places to be a scammer because next day everyone forgets about your scam listen he has 100 million bucks in
6:54
in his wallet he's like I don't know what to do with like you know if you maybe you can tell me what to do with it
6:59
let's I'm not benefiting I'm not benefit crazy guys it's crazy now the same guy
7:05
apparently he was also early sniping Melania and um and other coins in
7:11
particular so he's involved in a lot of this high-profile launches as a as a sniper listen to this you know a lot of
Hayden Davis was also behind Melania?
7:17
people have linked you to the milania launch and that is a big question on everyone's mind mine especially which is
7:23
were you part of the milania launch and was that sniped as well um
7:31
I mean look I think that I mean I told you like beforehand this before this started I'm I'm happy to share the truth
7:36
but uh I mean you're you're you're you're you're asking a question that's um it's just I mean I'll answer but it's
7:44
it's factually going to put me in into a lot of danger um which is fine I'll answer um I was part of it um I think
7:50
the the team did want to snipe it because of how big the snipe was on trumps um and we weren't the uh we we
7:56
definitely weren't the big sniper um we were not the that what we were trying to avoid um and uh we didn't make any there
8:03
was no money made from the Melania team on any we didn't take any liquidity out
8:08
zero okay wow that's uh like shocking news
8:14
but I want to zoom in on that point you said like well we didn't take any liquidity out one of the wallets we traced to the pory thing the ptoy you
8:20
know thing your wallet or not I don't know if it's your whoever's wallet that was sent money to a wallet which had
8:25
like got sent $1.5 million of Melania token from something called milania - liquidity to.ou and then that wallet
8:32
seemed to sell Melania tokens that it received for free so you said y'all didn't sell any liquidity but I I didn't
8:39
swap liquidity didn't swap liquidity didn't swap into single-sided I didn't say there was no uh there was no money sold there's a difference between
8:44
swapping the liquidity and and selling liquidations those are two different things okay so you all swapped you
8:49
didn't sell or the other way around no other way around other way I swapped I didn't not sell anyway
8:56
this is why the market is very depressed now to me it's weird because I didn't buy it like thank God but the Bitcoin
9:03
pric is at the same price as on Friday but you know the market is like going crazy people are now after this guy this
9:09
Hayden guy they the whole industry is mobilizing let's see what's going to happen now what happened was also that
9:15
da Dave Porton he bought 5 million in the coin he lost like all of it but then
9:21
this guy people are exaggerating his shoulder this guy he actually refunded
9:26
him he used 5 million out of the 100 million to refund they Port so there you go now people are saying that this is
9:31
the evolution of the scammer you remember this kid from like a year ago this was when P fan was new he launched
9:38
some rug very very quickly he was like 12 years old now he he evolved into this guy now
9:46
this guy is another YouTuber he rugged something uh like a few months back I don't know exactly what happened there
9:51
but as you can see this broccoli had the Pokemons they're now evolving into their final stage which is this Hayden guy
10:02
is is the haen guy this is the evolution from the young guy to the middle one middle strong and now it it is in the
10:09
strongest form with the hayen so guys listen it's crazy how memes can really
10:14
affect even political careers because again Argentinian president is now charged with fraud because he tweeted
Dont complain on permission less
10:20
about this coin he tweeted about it it ped then this hidden guy you know swapped he did not sell okay uh that was
10:28
with Melania but yeah anyway anyway so um it's crazy so you really got to be
10:34
careful here because this Market is now in the final year in the final year there's a lot of craziness going on uh
10:40
and a lot of scams that's one of the the the big signals that is the final year but uh it is what it is it is what it is
10:47
if we have a permissionless system a permissionless system means that anyone can do anything some people are saying oh no Solana is so bad because it has
10:53
this rocks listen it's permissionless you know complaining about Solana as a chain because it has rocks you know it's like complaining that Bitcoin is used
11:00
for Crime here and there like at the end of the day it's permissionless you can do whatever you want you remember how
11:06
eth got a lot of a lot of slack for for having icos everyone said Oh e has icos
11:12
it's only used for rug pool icos listen it's permissionless it's permissionless anybody can do anything you want
11:17
permission you go to your bank okay you go kyc and you stay there and you don't
11:23
come to crypto you want permission permission based you want permissionless you have everything here you have icos
11:29
scams on eth ruining the whole chain in 2017 people were oh it's so bad eth is
11:34
so bad vitalic build an Ico scam machine scam Factory now the same thing is on Solana because Solana is the better e
11:41
this cycle so everyone who wants to do anything including the rug pools they do it on now people oh no Solana now now
11:47
it's the E guys the thing is now the E guys are saying oh no Solana is only for scams listen it's permissionless do you
11:53
know permissionless what it means look it up in dictionary because permissionless means anyone can do anything you can do good you can do bad
12:01
you can do middle thing no one cares about you can do anything you can do anything it's permissionless you want
12:07

Market Update ‚ÄºÔ∏è
13:37
Bitcoin minus 1.2% we have e minus 0.3 xrp minus 4.6 look solad is taking a hit
13:44
because everyone saying oh you know all the scams on SOL iist it's permissionless it's permissionless but it is affecting the price looking at the
13:52
uh at the monthly Solan is like looking at the monthly here it's minus 25% for cardano minus uh 18% for E so eth is
14:00
actually a bit faster now maybe it's going to finally you know move quicker on the monthly weest L minus
14:07
22% um Avalanche let's see minus 37 so I mean all in all a lot of these l1s
14:12
they're all around like 20 25 like some of them 37% down and Solan is not
14:18
outperforming like it's in line it's in line it's minus 22 cardano minus 25 e is
14:23
the only one which is a bit better like maybe it is the bottom for eth I mean holy crap that would be that would be very nice like if it finally bottomed
14:30
out but it's still down 20% approximately you know you know day here day there today maybe salana pumps 5% is
14:37
as always it's it's always pumps when Market is up but it pumps not a lot so let's see at the end of the day it's uh
14:44
it's it's too much it's too much sell pressure across the whole Space currently and there's no like clear uh
14:51
over performance anywhere everything is down the same Doge minus 3% today we have um uh let's see what I mean
14:58
everything everything is down guys everything we're losing money with friends in real time Litecoin minus 5% uh we have uh H yeah I mean
15:06
everything is down guys everything is down everything is down if you feel that you're down you you know that your neighbor is down more because maybe he
15:12
holds Jupiter and is down 11% and you're only down 5% today maybe your neighbor he has you know maybe he has um yeah I
15:20
mean everything's like 5 7% so everything is down guys if you're wrecked I'm just look at the
15:26
Libra maybe your neighbor had Libra okay and you didn't have Libra so all in all
15:31
everyone is wrecked but that's how it is in crypto sometimes we're up sometimes we're down sometimes we're sideways and
15:36
is is is the fun of it like that's that's the whole idea here okay you you think it's going to go straight up no in
15:42
most cases it it is sideways guys most days of the year we're just sideways we're just coasting so this is really
15:49
turning into a fat consolidation kind of like here you know here we were from February until November holy crap I I
15:56
hope we don't repeat this timeline because now we're from yeah I mean basically you can say like here from November end of November let's
16:03
say from December until now February yeah I mean it's third month let's see
16:09
maybe it's going to take eight months like here maybe less but we're Bitcoin is the same it's the same as last week
16:14
nothing has changed now let's speak about the big news guys the big news is that Fort Knox is going to get audited
16:19
Elon Musk just realized uh yesterday well two days ago that um Fort Knox
16:26
where all the gold in the US Reserve is held that he sell at Fort KNX he just
16:31
realized Elon just realized that it's not audited it's not audited and you know that Elon is the audit guy he audits everything in the US he cuts all
16:38
the spending he makes the government accountable so he just realized you know actually it's not reviewed since 1974 no
Gold üëë missing?
16:46
one has audited the Fort Knox and actually um confirmed the US Gold
16:51
reserve for 50 years okay 50 years so maybe it's there maybe the gold is not
16:57
there how do we know how do we know we don't we don't okay for 50 years it's
17:02
not been audited and now there are Congressman calling for the audit of Fort Knox Elon Musk wants to audit Fort
17:10
Knox and likely guys there is going to be some issues found there because even when you look at Bank of England bank of
17:17
England doesn't have all the gold it claims it has because the Reserve Bank of of Australia who has gold at Bank of
17:24
England they basically sounded the alarm already in 2021 saying that there are many fake gold bars basically the
17:31
existence of fake gold bars has been detected in the past by the presence of duplicate serial numbers so this is the
17:38
problem with gold and you know where I'm Hing you know where I'm hitting because you cannot trust gold Reserve if a
17:43
country says that they have you know this many tons of gold Reserve you cannot trust it you don't know it you're
17:48
going to count it you're going to go down to Fort no and count it you cannot count it you cannot verify so the only
17:55
way for countries to have credible credible gold Reserve is you have
18:01
Bitcoin is the only way it's the only only only only only way another issue is of course that your gold is casted by a
18:08
third party like I don't know why everyone is using Bank of England uh Australia is using Bank of England to
18:14
cast cast the gold they cannot build their own uh their own facility uh it seems weird Venezuela they lost a bunch
18:21
of gold as well because the UK took it saying that they need to wait for the government to change to be Democratic
18:27
and maybe it makes sense Maybe it's fair but it's also crazy that whole countries have their gold reserves in uh third
18:35
party third party custodian another example is of course Russia it wasn't gold but they had 300 billion worth of
18:42
assets I guess currency like bank account balance uh different investment
18:47
accounts so their Reserve Russia's Reserve was also seized when they attacked Ukraine and again maybe it it
18:54
makes sense like politically uh and uh um and um ethically maybe it makes sense
19:00
it's not really about this that we're discussing we're discussing that it's crazy that it is like that because you
19:06
could just have Bitcoin you can have your own self custody of Bitcoin it's way better it's way better for the
19:11
country because number one you actually have credible you have credible reserves that
19:17
anyone can audit in real time you can have second based audit every second an audit bum bum bum bum bum so that's
19:23
number one number two you actually own your reserves because for some reason no one really owns their own reserves right
19:30
now as you can see all countries and nothing is audited no one knows who the hell has how much Fort nox even you know
19:36
the country that everyone thinks should have full credibility when it comes to reserves the US you know England UK man
19:43
they have no audit they have no audit they don't have the goal they don't have it maybe someone took it 50 years ago it
19:49
could it could have been 30 years ago someone did like a secret Heist of the fort KNX and no one knows okay it's like
19:55
the perfect crime there was even there was even a James Bond movie about it about the what is it like little finger
20:01
or what's his name like the gold finger what's his name in in James Bond go look
20:06
it up this was this is an old movie like from the 70s or what to 60s they actually uh the the the the evil guys
20:14
the the pro antagonists so to speak Goldfinger they actually Rob the for
20:21
forth knock maybe it happened maybe it happened in the 80s we don't know they need to audit it as soon as soon as possible so that's that this what's
20:28
going to happen guys uh Elon pushes Trump to audit for KNX they audit the crap out of it audit reveals there is
20:35
less than 500 tons of gold and there should have been like 5,000 so maybe there's less than 90% um sorry more than
20:41
90% missing could be Trump realizes China and Russia have way more gold than the us but very little Bitcoin Trump
20:48
issues executive order for the Bitcoin Reserve money printer goes B and US buys as much Bitcoin as the market will sell
20:55
price of gold collapses in Bitcoin terms China and Russia realiz Trump got the jump on them and start trying to acquire
21:00
bitcoin price of gold collapses further in Bitcoin terms Peter Shi is admitted to a mental
21:05
[Laughter] hospital I mean why not because it is
21:11
auditable it's auditable all of this gold is just laying there you cannot count it it's a pet rock if you want a
21:18
pet rock have at least a good pet rock like Bitcoin it's a good pet rock and your pet rock is not good whatever you
21:24
have there with the gold is not good anyway guys this is a very important news because if Fort NOS gets audited
21:30
and there are issues and there will be issues you know that um it's going to be it's going to be a lot of light on
21:37
bitcoin because Bitcoin is literally the solution now let's move on to the uh to the bigger coins so e listen we need we
21:44
need the bottom to be printed in in E Bitcoin chart it hasn't really happened
ETH Bottomed?
21:49
yet but maybe it starts like at some point eth is going to pump like at some point at some point we don't know when
21:54
maybe soon maybe not let's see cordano what's happening here with cardano I
Cardano bullish?
22:00
mean looking okay looking okay it is higher than it was here in March last year it just needs to hold this level if
22:07
it holds this level from higher than March last year then it's you can say it's it's building up a nice Trend here
22:13
but uh yeah I mean you see here in March it went from 0.7 to 0.3 so it can go
22:19
down very fast so be careful but then it goes up very fast I mean that's the that's the beauty of crypto it goes down
22:25
fast but then up even faster so cardan is looking okay I mean in the great scheme of things like Alin in general
22:31
don't look too good but in the great scheme of things like if you are to compare it's looking okay in terms of
22:37
Solana Solana has a quite strong Trend here I mean if you compare to cardano short is like night and day the bull
22:44
trend is strong it's using this old Peaks here as um as support right now so
22:50
old resistance is now turning into support uh and also there's a lot of this
22:56
unsubstantiated uh fud Within know it's only for scams exactly the same thing was told about E when icos happen when a
23:03
chain is used and when there is bull market there's there's going to be a lot of scams there okay and in reality it's
23:09
a bit of you know proof that the chain is nice when all the scams are there because the scammers want good Tech they
23:15
want good Tech okay they want fast confirmation you know it's like anything internet was also you know when you had
23:22
inent crime go up it means that man Tech is good good G good scammers always want
23:29
good take when the car was invented first people that used the car scammers so you can rob the bank you can drive
23:36
fast okay you don't want car you don't want the horse is bad Tech a car good Tech you want good Tech so I mean in
23:43
reality all new inventions all new good techs are used by scammers always always
23:49
always so when it DS like this I mean it's un un abanti my English is sleeping
23:56
in now in terms of a Avalanche Avalanche still using this previous lows here as
Avalanche
24:02
as support let's see if it can hold it like the previous levels and don't break down further in terms of news for
24:07
Avalanche there is some news like this guy Santiago he is launching a an L1 for business he says he's going to be
24:13
business op based operation that he's doing it's a chain to onboard businesses put the GDP on chain he is using uh
24:20
Avalanche in order to create his L1 he is onboarding a bunch of talent into his
24:26
team you can read here and I mean aage they are trying to position themselves as this you know business OS uh OS for
24:33
for businesses and this is what this Santiago guy is saying that you know it's been aspiring to see the reception
24:39
to the inversion inversion is here the L1 over the last 24 hours so far most almost everyone has R behind the vision
24:45
and Mission build the best user acquisition channel for crypto and accelerate mainstream crypto adoption but that's like you know this this
24:51
statement it's everyone is saying that everyone is saying that you know build better ux for like there are a million
24:57
chains that say that but let's see maybe he succeeds the mission transcends maximalism if you build a killer product
25:03
you believe in so yeah um so they will uh do this uh chain for business
25:10
but first we need to own produ through stable and organic channel one that doesn't lead to speculation but rather with essential services that pound for
25:16
pound are faster better and cheaper than the alternative no one cares if it's crypto so yeah I mean maybe it makes sense that that he's building this L1
25:24
it's uh like Trad five but it's super fast and uh it's cheap cheap and you don't even know it's crypto and you have
25:30
all of the uh crypto uh crypto benefits from it and he's building on Avalanche
25:35
so uh he knows that L1 will be built on a because it's one of only places to
25:41
truly customize the chain for specific use cases and uh support that covers the Gambit there we go having our own chain
25:48
lets us purposefully build a stack that uh a stack exactly to the specs of the
25:54
businesses that we acquire and really allows us to go tellor m there you go there you go so that's that now guys I
26:02
mean crazy things are happening in the world right now and looking at the crypto Market I feel that we have
26:08
summarized the Z guys very Qui very very nice in all in all possible ways but also you know one of the biggest things
Free Speech
26:16
that is happening in the world right now is that this idea of free speech of
26:21
self- custody all of these things that we love hearing crypto they are really at odds with a lot of the old Power
26:27
structure that's why you know during the last years whenever any politician or any uh
26:34
any regulator spoke about self-cast they were thinking and speaking about it with contempt you know
26:42
they call this non-hosted wallets you know they don't say self-cast they say non-hosted wallets this is what happened
26:48
many many different regulations and reports and all of that um as if it's something weird you know why do you use
26:54
a non-hosted wallet you should use a hosted wallet like a kyc wallet so all of this that's happening in crypto with
27:00
free speech freedom of expression uh self- custody it's really at odds with
27:06
the old Power structures as you know in the US there is a new government we have Trump and it's a big change because
27:14
Trump is pro crypto Pro freee all these different things and it's crazy now that
27:19
JD Vance his vice president is coming to the EU and he is I mean he has no mercy
VP JD Vance üá∫üá∏, NO MERCY for EU
27:26
he has no mercy and the they don't know what to do what to make out of it they don't know how to handle it they they
27:33
even start crying like the German guy the German politicians they start crying out of fear or disorientation I will
27:40
show you I will soon show you listen to this this is JD Vance um in the EU and at Munich in Germany like wrecking them
27:48
fully listen to this and unfortunately when I look at Europe today it's
27:53
sometimes not so clear what happened to some of the cold Wars winners I Look to
28:00
Brussels where EU commiss commissars warned citizens that they intend to shut
28:05
down social media during times of civil unrest the moment they spot what they've judged to be quote hateful content or to
28:14
this very country where police have carried out raids against citizens suspected of posting anti-feminist
28:21
comments online as part of quote combating misogyny on the internet a day
28:26
of action I Look to Sweden where two weeks ago the government convicted a
28:31
Christian activist for participating in Quan burnings that resulted in his
28:37
friend's murder and as the judge in his case chillingly noted Sweden's laws to
28:43
supposedly Protect free expression do not in fact Grant and I'm quoting a free
28:50
pass to do or say anything without risking offending the group that holds
28:56
that belief and perhaps most concerningly I Look to our very dear friends the United
29:02
Kingdom where the backslide away from conscience rights has placed the basic Liberties of religious Britain in
29:08
particular in the crosshairs a little over two years ago the British government charged Adam
29:13
Smith Connor a 51-year-old physiotherapist and an army veteran with
29:19
the heinous crime of standing 50 m from an abortion clinic and silently praying
29:26
for 3 minutes not obstructing anyone not interacting with anyone just silently praying on his
29:33
own and after British law enforcement spotted him and demanded to know what he was praying for Adam replied simply it
29:41
was on behalf of The Unborn son he and his former girlfriend had aborted years
29:47
before now the officers were not moved Adam was found guilty of you get the
29:52
point you get the point now the EU bureaucrats I mean they don't know what
29:58
what to make out this guy this guy is so pathetic the German guy he starts to cry
Germany üá©üá™ cries for disagreements
30:04
oh my god listen to this it's pathetic pathetic there is a zero zero te in this
30:11
guy it's not even low te it's zero crazy listen to this a sorry sorry sorry headphone users
30:20
my bad my bad let's see after the speech of Vice President
30:26
Vance on Friday we have to fear that our common value base is not that common
30:33
anymore I'm very grateful to all those European politicians that spoke out and
30:39
reaffirmed the values and principles that they are defending no one did this
30:44
better than presidency selinski let me conclude and this becomes difficult
30:57
[Music]
31:02
what is it it's
31:08
pathetic what is this I mean what kind of
31:15
society has it become what is this JD Vance just said guys you are you are
31:21
censoring people you're putting them in jail for Rising online and this guy is crying
31:29
oh no the values are not the same like which values you you are censoring which
31:34
values okay crazy it's crazy guys it's crazy now what's interesting is that
31:41
this guy he was laughing when Trump said the years ago that Germany is going to
31:46
get so wrecked with Energy prices because it's so dependent on Russia you know that these EU bureaucrats they
31:53
think that us is a bit dumb you know uh if you're watching from the US big shout out to you but you should know that you
31:58
know in Europe like in Sweden in Germany everyone looks at you as a bit dumb but
32:04
I mean the reality is reversed but they always think you know oh you know this freaking rednecks they elected Trump you
32:11
know they're so dumb you know oh hahaa they have all of these guns they're so dumb you know they have all of the guns
32:17
we in Europe who don't have guns we have guys with a car driving into you know what we have uh you know all kinds of
32:24
other things but hahaa it's the it's the US that is so dumb they have the they have the Trump you know the freaking
32:29
rednecks and so this is what you see here in front of you how Trump is basically telling them exact exact exact
32:36
truth and this guys bureaucrats They're laughing hahaaa look here this this is
32:42
from 2018 this 2018 and it's the same guy that just cried look
32:50
here Germany will become totally dependent on Russian energy if it does
32:56
not immediately change [Music]
33:03
course yeah here that laughing this is this this is the guy who who cried today
33:08
and you know CNBC says oh it's so misleading what Trump said you know you
33:14
see with time everything is coming into the correct position now what is interesting is that in Germany in
Germany now in focus
33:21
particular you have a lot of stuff happening right now there is a guy who is investigated after calling German
33:27
Vice counselor an idiot so we've been speaking about the UK and all of the all of the speech uh issues there that you
33:34
can go thrown in jail for for all kinds of stuff in Germany it's maybe even worse now it's even worse so look here
33:42
if you call the German Vice councellor idiot you will get thrown in jail so this what's happening also here there is
33:49
a whole 60 Minute um episode about Germany now airing listen to this they
33:54
really explain how they think about jailing people for social media posts Listen to Here is it a crime to insult
German prosecutors on 60 min
34:02
somebody in public yes yes it is and it's a crime to insult them online by
34:07
the way these guys who are sitting here they are the pro prosecutors they are the ones who are throwing people in jail
34:13
they create the case and all of that so this these three these three people just so you know the context Okay let's listen is it a crime to insult somebody
34:20
in public yes yes it is and it's a crime to insult them online as well yes the
34:26
fine could be even higher yeah if you insult someone in the internet why
34:32
because in Internet it stays there if we are talking here face to face you insult
34:37
me I insult you okay Finish but if you in the internet if I insult you or a politician that sticks around forever
34:44
yeah the prosecutors explain German law also prohibits the spread of malicious
34:50
gossip violent threats and fake quotes if somebody posts something that's not
34:56
true and then some somebody else reposts it or likes it are they committing a
35:01
crime yeah in the case of reposting it is a crime as well because um the reader can't distinguish whether you just
35:07
invented uh this or just reposted it that's the same for us the punishment
35:13
for breaking hate speech laws can include jail time for repeat offenders
35:18
oh my God holy crap guys I mean be careful you know it this me are we are we the
35:24
Buddies it's kind of like happening in real time now also I mean you can watch
35:29
more here there is also in the same episode I guess they follow like a SWAT
35:35
you know a SWAT Navy SEAL spetznas kind of group to arrest a guy who posted
35:41
something on social media uh let's actually listen to this together so they're like you know breaking in early
Social Media task force Germany
35:47
early Dawn they're striking the guy with like Navy Seals by German one listen to
35:53
this it's 6:01 on a Tuesday morning and we were with State Police as they raided
36:00
this apartment in Northwest Germany inside six armed officers
36:07
searched a suspect's home then seized his laptop and cell phone prosecutors
36:12
say those Electronics may have been used to commit a crime the crime posting a
36:19
racist cartoon online holy crap you post a cartoon now
36:26
what is interesting also you know that I mean I'm personally I'm very much into Tech like I work every day in Tech and
36:32
crypto and all of that and more and more of the tech guys are starting to realize that uh it's got to change like this
36:39
this guy here for example dhh he's very well known in the tech space because he is the inventor of Ruby on Rails he's
Truth vs Woke battle
36:45
running this 37 signals they have like a project management solution and so he's
36:51
very well known in the space and if you look at his timeline now like he's all in on this on defeating the vog uh U
36:57
mind mind virus like here for example he posted this another thing from uh Finland this is after there was a lot of
37:04
uh crime here with the I mean you can read yourself and so in response to this crime that you see on the screen they
37:11
did this this little song uh I mean it's it's crazy listen to this
37:19
[Music] me stop don't tou me then
37:25
is so I mean end of day everyone who is interested in in free speech in self
37:31
custody like things are happening things are happening here and the the the old
37:37
order they don't know what to do they start arresting people for like cartoons online you know oh maybe this is a bit
37:43
bad you know let's let's arrest you but you know the change is inevitable
37:48
because crypto is not going to go anywhere you see now everywhere big uh headlines like everyone knows like in
37:54
Sweden the the bombings are crazy there is like 30 bombings since the start of the year and it's just going up and up
38:00
and up and uh yeah I mean you cannot hide the reality so at the end of the day this will result in free speech
38:08
prevailing number one self- custody prevailing you have that in the US already and here is where it's very
38:14
interesting with the US where actually it is true that us maybe is the only country that that has free speech that's
38:20
super super strong like this fundamental rights is protected in the US because you see we had some years of the uh of
38:27
the where they tried to do something like in the EU but then it abruptly came to a
38:32
stop with Trump so there are mechanisms in place to quickly reverse craziness and that's very very good in the EU like
38:39
there's no such thing that's the thing the how to change I I I don't know how they're going to change it maybe afd is
38:45
GNA get some nice position now in the German election when is that by the way guys all of you Germans let me know in
38:50
the comment section when is that when when is the afd and the uh and the
38:56
election because maybe that's the only way like things can change but that's going to be only like locally and I'm sure other parties will not even work
Crypto is the way out
39:02
with them so yeah anyway for crypto this is good because it highlights the
39:08
authoritarian Tendencies of the state if you say something online you may get
39:13
thrown in jail and guess what they're going to take your money so have some crypto have some crypto you you have you
39:19
you do things online just in case you know have some crypto because you will you will get debanked like who the hell
39:25
knows what's going to happen but with crypto you you know it's protected by math you know so the more of this
39:30
authoritarianism we see the the the more the better is the case for crypto always always always also you see crypto is
39:38
very important from the perspective of just balancing out this uh left uh uh
39:43
left craziness that is sometimes getting popular among young people especially like it's crazy but as soon as you have
39:49
a bit of crypto you realize hey don't touch my crypto you want my crypto to do what to what what are you spending on
39:55
let's see what the hell US government spend on okay I don't want to spend on that so I want low tax let me vote for
40:01
low tax so crypto actually is a catalyst to uh to to this values of ownership of
40:08
private property it's very very important like crypto crypto is not just you know some some stuff with trade like
40:14
it is uh money it is politics it is society it is like all of the different
40:23
human uh aspects of the human life all of the different philosophies uh how you
40:28
say science Sciences they're all coming together like it's it's way bigger than that anyway guys let's go to q& name I
40:34
feel that we have captured everything very very nicely if you are in Germany like get out guys get out if you're in the UK get out move somewhere else
Q&A, Coffee & Shill
40:41
because it's getting crazy but don't forget to to to vote uh it's whenever is
40:47
that in Germany go go vote uh uh and yeah maybe something's going to get fixed but it won't that's another
40:52
problem it won't no matter how you vote like it doesn't matter in reality does but they just do it just do it s d but
40:59
you know that doesn't matter go go go somewhere else go somewhere else that's the best that's the
41:05
best or you know it may happen like change may happen but it's going to take decades and it's going to get worse
41:11
before it gets better okay because the feedback cycle is so slow you know it's
41:17
you vote and then you wait for years until you vote again and like things they they change but you know slow slow
41:24
slow slow slow go where I mean it really on your depends on your taste in Europe
41:31
there's Portugal in Asia you I mean there is endless countries in Asia with low tax good weather you can go to I
41:39
mean Latin America also has so explore just travel the world a bit so you see that other countries are actually nice
41:45
because many people who live in Germany or the UK they think that those countries are good and everything else is crap which it was maybe in the 80s
41:52
you know Europe was good you go to Asia it's like slum and uh poor
41:57
poverty but now it's very different it's actually vice versa because European cities look like slums and high crime I
42:06
mean just look at what we read with Sweden like thirsty bombings like someone from Thailand sees that they're
42:12
gonna be what the hell is happening um so this is the thing many people they
42:18
just need to travel a bit now for you to be able to get out of uh uh let's say
42:24
Germany you better have a good um uh good profession like if you do anything
42:29
when it comes to coding you're safe man you can live anywhere you can take your laptop you can go anywhere like anything
42:35
with crypto also you can go anywhere if you have some job where you need to be in the office it is tough like that's
42:41
the problem and if you've been watching this channel since 2017 I've been telling you go into uh coing like learn
42:48
this skills that are that are worldwide that are needed worldwide like one of the biggest scams is when people go into
42:56
Prof questions like you know law or medicine not because they really love that like you know some people they love
43:02
medicine that's great but the problem is it may be tough to like go to another
43:07
country because the standard is lower there like I don't actually know but I would guess that if you want to move to
43:13
Asia and you're a doctor I mean it's not going to be as nice as being a doctor in uh in in Europe like I'm just guessing
43:20
I'm just guessing so if you go into medicine for the reason you know to be rich and free and travel it that's not
43:27
the the way to go and I know many people who sadly go there because their parent told you know you become a doctor you're going to be you know and maybe you are
43:34
slightly more well off but you know it's the same Rat Race now medicine you go into if you really love people you love
43:40
helping that that then it makes sense then it makes perfect sense that's your live calling that that makes perfect
43:45
sense but yeah uh I I I've seen like a lot of people my age who went into medicine to have like a nice life like
43:52
listen it's it's not it's not the reason and then law it's another one where you also go there mainly because you know
43:58
it's like this top tier tier one profession but you are kind of tied to a country yes you can learn the law of
44:04
other country maybe you do international law but it's tough man it's tough it's tough uh if you are crypto law in crypto
44:12
law then maybe it is more International but it's also like tough tough you don't don't pick any profession that's too
44:18
much tied to jurisdiction or that's where you have different levels of pay
44:23
and compensation depending on Country you don't want that like again medicine is is an example you're a doctor in U
44:29
you know in Asia like I don't know how much you would be making maybe not too much in Europe maybe you make okay like
44:35
middle class higher middle class but developer does the best if you're a really good developer man I mean it it
44:43
is like life on easy mode in many ways you may get replaced by AI but I don't think so if you use AI if you use AI
44:50
you're going to be using AI because I tried myself cursor the other day man
44:56
it's not good I was thinking okay let let me try uh you know in in the past before crypto I
45:02
was full-time developer so I but I haven't been full-time developer or uh you know any kind of developer for the
45:08
last five years maybe even longer yeah like since 20 2018 is so I thought okay
45:14
let me try the new AI tools let me try the new AI tools for developing maybe I
45:19
can like do stuff quicker because you know I as a Founder we build Morales like we do all these things like one of
45:25
the bottlenecks I have is that when I want something to happen and um the team needs to deliver like maybe some idea
45:32
some prototype like if it's possible for me to quickly like code it uh that's the best that's the best and one option I
45:38
mean I could code it like you know but it's going to take too much time I don't want it to take a lot of time um but but
45:45
in case I have let's say an idea a protype I want to build and AI can build it so it's like a real app but AI builds
45:50
I thought man is brilliant like let me do it and man it did do an app but the
45:55
amount of debugging it took to make it run holy crap uh so I can tell you that AI will not replace devs anytime soon
46:03
anytime soon yes it did kind of what I wanted but like it was crazy like to run
46:09
it it was crazy it was crazy it was crazy you know
46:14
uh with AI what you could do quite nice is to build apps which are not really
46:21
heavy dep on dependencies like let's say you want a simple like noj server that
46:26
accept some parameter and you know does some something maybe call some simple API AI can do that but if you do
46:34
something more complex like I was trying to build the react native app with cursor M like the amount of dependency
46:41
there like it's crazy it's crazy and it just digs itself in a deeper and zeper
46:47
hole so yeah I mean what is the conclusion here be basically be Dev if
46:54
you want the nice life freedom to travel all of that not be tied your [ __ ] is held by this German dude who is uh you
47:01
know crying on stage and then jails you for posting online you don't want that he has your Kon you want to escape that
47:07
as a Dev you can do it if you are in other like professions like law and Medicine Man it may be tougher I don't
47:13
know it may it may be a bit tougher maybe you you need to be internationalized so yeah be a Dev as
47:18
soon as possible become a Dev okay let's see I actually have to go in 3 minutes
47:23
so big shout out to travel 11 for time stepping us today and that's the best thing with Q&A
47:28
because sometimes I can just talk about uh you give me some I don't even know how we got in here did we even do Q&A
47:34
guys did someone ask this that's the best thing with having your own channel you can just have a
47:40
monologue and it's great it's great did we have any qas did someone ask about this was oh yeah it was exactly where to
47:47
relocate exactly exactly that's it for Q&A today guys one
47:54
question uh tomorrow we have another one everyone let's see big shout out to travel 11 enjoy your uh your Monday new
48:04
week New Opportunities have a good good week uh and uh Smash Up the like click
48:09
the buy button below for trading you support the channel you have a nice platform to go long to go short to get
48:15
wrecked you can get super wrecked with leverage so be very careful but you can also make money but always use risk
48:20
management risk management risk management risk management guys see you all here po I mean Poland it's it's

48:50
like man it's oh my God no you know they tell you go for a walk for your human
48:57
for your mental health you go for a walk but man it's like it's great like my mental health degrades if I go for a
