The Biography Through Oral Accounts of the Venerable Great Being Konchog Gyaltsen Palzang Po
By Gungru Sherab Zangpo

Homage to the Guru! Victory to that master, the venerable one who is definitively Vajradhara himself. Though his body, speech, and mind are indeed the Three Jewels, he appears as a spiritual friend holding the saffron victory banner. Victory to that glorious, wealthy one of beneficial activities! His complete biography is precisely that.

A supreme noble one said:
"How could those like myself understand?
Yet since others strongly urged,
I will write briefly based on
His own words and the truthful speech
Of those who long served him directly."

This Venerable Great Being named Konchog Gyaltsen Palzangpo, similar to the unobstructed Bodhisattvas, had perfected the two minds of enlightenment and completed the two accumulations long before countless lifetimes. Though he dwelt as the essence of the complete assembly of the three seats' deities of the fruition time, as the nature of the Great Vajradhara himself at the level of great accomplishment, as it is said: "To whoever needs taming, in that very form he appears" and "Taking the form of monastics, upasakas, householders and others for all beings, he brings all disciples to maturity."

Similarly, in this degenerate age in this Land of Snows, taking the form of a spiritual friend, he held aloft the precious victory banner of the Omniscient Buddha's teachings and established all disciples on the path of ripening and liberation.

Regarding this, there are:
1. First, how he took birth and entered the monastic path
2. How he trained his mind through study, contemplation and meditation with that support
3. How he possessed the qualities of being learned, disciplined and noble, and activities endowed with the four means of gathering disciples
4. How he held and benefited the teachings and beings through teaching, debating and composing, along with many auspicious signs of benefit to the doctrine and beings, possessing various supernatural perceptions

First:

First, he came to Ling Kya Monastery in Upper Mu, which was a temple maintained by a spiritual friend known as Trangpa from Trang Dragmar Temple near the glorious Sakya. He was born in the male Earth-Dragon year as the son of father Konchog Zangpo and mother Namkha Kyong, and was named Konchog Dar. Furthermore, his patrilineal clan was Dong and maternal clan was Zhang, being of the Tibetan royal minister lineage. His great-grandfather was Zhang Öden, whose son was Zhang Yunga, whose son was the master's father Konchog Zangpo. These ancestors were naturally peaceful and disciplined, devoted to Noble Avalokiteshvara, and it is said they lived long lives. Yunga lived for 76 years, from the Hare to Dragon years, while his father lived for 49 years, from the Sheep to Ox years. From his youth while living with his parents, he saw the endless nature of samsara and worldly existence. Though all his conduct was purely dharmic, others did not understand its meaning and called him unmanly. When he spoke using examples of impermanence, they said he was being negative. Furthermore, due to the power of familiarity from previous lives, many states of samadhi arose clearly and he demonstrated many supernatural perceptions, but as there were too many, they were not written down. Also, at age six or seven, at a monastery near Ling Kya, at Pen Tang Monastery, it is said he received mind training and a single Hevajra empowerment from a master called Lama Wang Öpa. Wang Öpa was [associated with] Chim Lobzang Drakpa and Namkha'i Naljorpa.

Having taken ordination vows with Öpa as preceptor and his father's uncle Palö as master, he was given the ordination name Konchog Gyaltsen Palzangpo. He stayed at Ling Kya until age thirteen. His mother passed away when he was thirteen.

2. How he trained his mind through study, contemplation and meditation with that support:

From ages fourteen to fifteen, he went before the abbot Kunmön of Gelung, Zurcho, and Jangseng. He studied the Prajñāpāramitā and Bodhicaryāvatāra, and heard the Bu-tika sections. At age eighteen, he gave great teaching expositions there. At age twenty, he requested Chöd instructions from Namkha'i Naljorpa and it is said extraordinary realizations arose. From the precious master Sherab Bumpa of Shutsal Monastery, who was an unobstructed lama, he received some Kālacakra earth-drawings and various teachings. That lama said it would be good to go study at Ngamring, so at age twenty-one he went to Ngamring. Under Master Lodrö Gyaltsen and Sanglo, he studied Prajñāpāramitā. By studying the Great Bu-tika for three years, he mastered all its words and meanings. Moreover, due to his previous training, he only needed to hear any scripture or reasoning once or twice to comprehend it. After doing the monastic rounds there at Ngamring, he returned for a time and received Kālacakra empowerment and other teachings from Lama Namchö. At age twenty-four, in the Hare year, he went to Latong.

During his studies with the great master Thugs-rje Palwa, who was a student of the learned master Nya-wön Kunga Drapa Chöpal Gönpo, he established all the meanings of Prajñāpāramitā through analysis and refutation, and it is said he mastered all difficult points of Prajñāpāramitā. Then he did the monastic rounds at glorious Sakya and became recognized as a scholar. At age twenty-five, in the Dragon year, he met with Master Yagpa, the Second Maitreya, at Shelkar and developed faith in him like he was the Buddha himself, and stayed with him for six months. Of those, two months were spent at the southern forest-covered mountain valley of Khulung. Then, invited by northerners, two months at Ngamring, and two months at Tsana Monastery, during which he studied Prajñāpāramitā. He said that since bodhicitta generation ceremonies were given during the teachings on generating bodhicitta, he also received those. At Tsana he met Master Gyalchogpa who had come from Central Tibet. In the Horse year, at age twenty-seven, Master Yagpa passed away at Sakya. It was said Gyalchogpa was appointed to teach. This master went to Mu and studied with the great siddha Namkhapa for seven months on Naro, Niguma and other teachings, and it is said extraordinary realizations arose. In the Sheep year, at age twenty-eight, he went before Master Gyalchogpa who was residing at Master Yagpa's religious estate of Mangkhar Mugulung. He studied with him for about seven years in total. First he studied logic and memorized Uyukpa's Great Treasury of Reasoning. After two months he had mastered all the words and meanings, and since he was already a good teacher, he entered directly into the great reasoning [texts]. Although he was already a great geshe, it was said one should progress gradually through the small and medium reasoning classes.

After that too he did not listen more, but studied the auto-commentary on Introduction [to the Middle Way]. After two months, he had mastered all words and meanings. Then at Bodong he studied the Abhidharmasamuccaya. He studied the Great Commentary [Tika] composed by Dzedpa Zhönyang, who was a student of Tsangnagpa Tsöndru Sengge and Dzedkyi Tön Kyabmi Sengge - two of the eight great lions of the Greater Geshe lineage of Sangphu. After two months, he had mastered all words and meanings. Although he wished to do monastic rounds at glorious Sakya since he was highly skilled in Abhidharma and other subjects, due to internal turmoil in the north he was unwell. So he went with Master Gyalchogpa as teacher and student to Ngulchu and studied mind training, from which extraordinary realizations arose. Then until the Dog year, it is said he went to something like an assembly gathering at Ngamring. In the Pig year, at age thirty-two, at Ngamring he received the permission blessing of Acala from the omniscient Master Rongtön and studied some Pramāṇa teachings for a few days. Then Master Rongtönpa and Gyalchogpa as teacher and student went to make requests before Namkhapa at the new place in Mu. The omniscient one studied Niguma's teachings and others for two months, went to hear Zhijé at Dingri, and traveled south to request Lamdré from Dorje Gönpo. Gyalchogpa studied the Three Cycles of Hevajra and other teachings for four months. Then at the beginning of the Rat year, at the new place, he again requested the previous instructions from Namkhapa. As for the empowerments and blessings, based on what he had received before, he practiced for four months.

Then Namkhapa became ill, and this master had a dream. Thinking it unbearable that such a great person should be ill, and when there was much blood from his nose, after making a detailed meal offering and requesting the remaining blessings be granted, he dreamed that even after the lama's passing, there remained many of the lama's bodhicitta [blessings]. Others say that all the continuity of Namkhapa's method and wisdom had transferred to the Drungpa. After completing all the activities following the lama's passing, he went up and performed many spiritual practices. He was among the seven spiritual friends who were disciples of Remdawa Zhönnu Lodrö, [along with] the two Sakya scholars Yak and Zhön. He was also a disciple of Namkha Naljor. From Palor Sherab, who was a master of the Five Treatises, he studied for two months the essential instructions on dependent origination and the commentary on Introduction to the Middle Way based on the Tika. In that Ox year, Master Sanglo was appointed as abbot of Gelung. He said: "You must become a teacher at our monastery in Ngamring. " Everyone said "I don't know how to train you. " Although he said many good monks would come, including his nephews, this master replied it would not be so. Even though one might be as great as a universal monarch or as wealthy as Vaiśravaṇa's son, he replied he had no such desires. [The other] responded, "If that's the case, go study the vast secret mantra at either Jonang or Zhalu. " It is said that later, when this master became learned in secret mantra, there even came a time when he needed to perform a long-life empowerment for him.

In the Tiger year, at age thirty-five, he went to Lhasa in Central Tibet and performed one hundred thousand circumambulations. When he went up to Upper Nyang, he met with the precious master from Nubchö Lung called Sönam Drak, who was a holy lama and the abbot of Gyalse Thogmepa. He was also a student of the student called Khenchen Tashi Tsul. Gangchen Kunga Pal, who was foremost among the seven spiritual friends of Remdawa, acted as abbot. Master Döndrub Rinchen of Nenying and the two teacher-students Chöje Gyaltsab acted as masters of the secret activities. Chöje Gyalchogpa acted as the timekeeper, and in the midst of a great assembly of monks, he received full ordination. Then in the Hare year, when he and Chöje Gyalchogpa stayed together as teacher and student at Bodong, when a monk of Chöje Kunga Zangpo called Nyag Re Mennag came for full ordination, this master said: "Is Lord Kunga Zangpo someone who does not look down on those of humble status who have good spinal joints? Although they say he is learned in the extensive secret mantra including the Bulugs and so forth, if someone like Kunga Gyaltsen of the Sakya tradition were learned..." The other replied, "That is not true. Our lama does not defer to patrons and great people, but greatly values humble practitioners. He is highly skilled in the Three Cycles and instructions of the Sakya tradition." This master then thought that he should request Cakrasaṃvara from Chöje Kunga Zangpo, as he wished to accomplish a lifetime of practice.

At the end of that Hare year, when water gathered, Chöje Gyalchogpa was invited. They said they would establish a dharma center. He was told to come study with the master. No one came to call. This master thought that this would not suffice and that he should go to Sakya to request Cakrasaṃvara. Thinking it would be good to make the request and go in one direction, he went to Chudü. When he told the master he was unable to study and had no desire to do so, [the master] was somewhat displeased. However, since there were reasons for not wanting to be a teacher at Ngamring that could be explained, after some difficulty the request was granted. He stayed there for two months, then teacher and student went together to Sakya. Then the master was invited to the north.

In that Dragon year, the great Dharma holder who had crossed the ocean of various philosophical systems of self and others met with the omniscient great Vajradhara Lord Ngorpa, who was teaching Lamdré to quite a few people at Shakya Zangpo's temple and staying somewhat isolated.

When this master sent a request saying he had come to request Cakrasaṃvara, [Ngorpa] said "If that's the case, look at these" and gave many texts on Cakrasaṃvara, which he mastered. Meeting at the temple, teacher and student became very close. He received many teachings including the three black Cakrasaṃvara cycles with root tantra, the four transmissions of Hevajra, and the Guhyasamāja Noble tradition. Lord Ngorpa said "Since a good understanding hasn't come from Kharsing, it would be good if you joined the Lamdré." When this master replied that he would not request Lamdré since he lacked the ability to make large offerings and feast gatherings, the lama said "The large offerings and receptions between teachers and students in earlier times were done because people were wealthy and when there were things to offer, it was considered to complete students' accumulations."

Nowadays, there is concern that the lineages of the Vajra Speech and others may be broken. He said that if worthy vessels appear, the teachings must be spread widely like pouring [water]. It appears that auspicious signs of benefiting beings appeared for this master.

Then in the Snake year, the Great Dharma King of Mahāyāna passed away. The master and his disciples taught extensively on the guidance of the Six Yogas and the explanation of the Hevajra Tantra, and declared all Indian and Tibetan traditions of the Six Yogas to be authoritative.

In the early part of the Horse year, Lord Ngorpa fell slightly ill. He did purification practices and went into retreat. When the retreat was ending, he called for this master and Ngari Konchog Özer. Upon meeting, he said "The retreat you did today was good. If you had not done it, harm would have come. Even if harm comes, there is no attachment to others' minds. Since the teachings of Carya and Kriya have not spread well in Tibet, I regret that they were not revived. And since you, master Konchog Gyaltsen, did not fully grasp Lamdré, my mind is troubled."

This master thought to himself, "Since he has shown me such care, I should request Lamdré. Even if it does not benefit others, I must focus on that main spiritual practice."

After that, he received Lamdré teachings for four months, then this lord went to Mus. In the following Sheep year, Lord Ngorpa went to Lho. During that interval, this lord went to stay at Sakya, and when summoned, he went. From there, some teachers and disciples went to stay at Kubum. He studied with two teachers - Master Sangye Pel and Tsulzangpa - who were teaching Pramāṇa according to Lord Yakpa's tradition. He received teachings on Yakpa's commentary, Pechö Rinpung, and others, and accompanied many circumambulators.

It is said that Master Sangye Pel was someone who definitively established the early and later oral teachings of Lord Yakpa. Lord Ngorpa came down after six months. From the end of the Monkey year through the beginning of the Bird year, for seven months he taught Lamdré. Although initially there were about seventy people, in the end only fourteen people, including this lord, received the complete practice instructions. Although the Lamdré teachings were given very extensively, he said they were not written down despite being numerous.

However, regarding the excellent structural outline of the teaching methods contained in the Lamdré notes that this lord composed at that time - since Lord Ngorpa did not give such teachings in later times, it is certain that he did not give them to anyone else as he had given them to this lord.

Then when this lord and his disciples were about to go to Ngor, there were both activities and Red teachings. This lord also taught explanations of Hevajra and other topics. From then until Lord Ngorpa was seventy-four and this lord was sixty-eight, they alternately traveled up to New Ngor Monastery and down to Mus.

Regarding the teachings on the Indian and Tibetan treatises and commentaries based on the Three Baskets and Four Classes of Tantra:
1. Six approaches of Kriyā tantra
2. Three classes of Caryā tantra
3. Many Yoga tantras including root and explanatory tantras of similar types
4. Three classes of Father tantras
5. Six approaches of Mother tantras, especially including:
    5.1 Explanatory teachings on the commentaries of Yoga and Saṃvara
    5.2 Profound explanatory teachings on the tantras alone and oral instructions
    5.3 Traditional explanatory teachings on the three Hevajra tantras with commentaries
    5.4 Profound explanatory teachings according to the oral instruction tradition

With regard to the Lamdré path and teaching [gsung ngag], what he heard from Lord Gonpawa of the lineage family is generally similar to what appears in most Lamdré volumes. As for the direct lineage that Lord Sachen heard directly from the Venerable Virūpa, it is an extremely profound cycle, most of which appears in the Red Book [pod dmar ma]. Furthermore, when Sachen condensed the instructions taught by the Venerable One through signs, he taught the condensed meaning up to the mantra path. Then when Lord Sakya Paṇḍita clarified the meaning of the signs, he taught three versions - extensive, medium, and condensed - which were solely about the mantra path. He also received all the practical applications and cycles of oral instructions of these, which should be known from this lord's record of teachings received. Also, when coming up from Ngor once, he received the Red Book along with its catalog. The spread of such uncommon instructions with their subtle details was solely due to this lord's kindness. After returning to Sakya for one year, he gave practice authorizations, bestowing the instructions of the four oral transmissions in the manner of filling a vase. Furthermore, at one point he received many teachings from Kunga Lama of Kharteng, including Vinaya transmissions. He was both his teacher and also a student of Rendawa. From Phagpa Yonten Gonpo at Dogtö Dewachen, he received the Vinaya Sūtra root text and commentary for two months, completely mastering both words and meaning. He said that commentary appeared to be like notes recording the key points of the extensive commentary. From that master, he received many teachings including the Karma Śatam, the two Kārikās (greater and lesser), Uddyotana, and others. In the Tiger year when this lord was sixty-nine, Lord Ngorpa went to Nubchölung. At Ngor, this lord gave the Nairātmyā empowerment to the Lamdré practitioners.

When told to speak of the inseparability of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, he went to study under the omniscient Rongton Chenpo at Lhasa and Nālandā. He received teachings on the Madhyamaka meditation stages and Prajñāpāramitā instruction manual, among others. Then while traveling up, during a meditation retreat at Lhotsa, in a dream there appeared a stone in front of this lord with a handprint impression, and of two butter lamps, one went out. Then he was invited to Nyenpo Monastery of Mus, where he taught Lamdré for six months. The fact that he established everyone in spiritual practices of four or three sessions and so forth was indicated by the handprint impression, and regarding the one extinguished butter lamp of the two, he said it was a sign that of the two - Master Lorin and the attendant - the attendant would die. At another time he went to Ngor. Although he had requested many times before without success, he received the special instructions called "The Four Precious Paths of Cakrasaṃvara That Raise the Path. " The flourishing of such profound paths was solely due to this lord's kindness. In the Dragon year when this lord was seventy-one, Lord Ngorpa went to Ngari. When this lord was told to stay at Ngor, he taught Lamdré and other topics and stayed for a while. Then going up, he practiced meditation in all the solitary places of Upper Mus. When previously staying at Ngor's seat, he was told he could use whatever disciples, wealth, ritual items and so forth as he wished. He said that at that time, he thought it might cause his mind, which had not been proud, to become proud. Although the reasons he needed to stay at Ngor were explained many times, there also came responses about this lord's wish to focus solely on meditation.

In reference to this lord, it was certain that if he did not maintain a monastic seat and focused solely on meditation practice, he would swiftly depart for the celestial realm. When meeting Lord Ngorpa at Sakya, he had a dream where there was a great ravine said to be of saṃsāra. When he said "I won't stay here, I will go to the celestial realm" and was about to fly, a monk from Upper Mus named Lodrö Chökyong grabbed his feet and wouldn't let go. When he arrived at Mus, there were many reasons why he needed to help with the education of someone called Lodrö Chökyong, who was the son of a physician. Later, this person changed his studies, learned medicine, and died under a collapsed house. He said, "We too seem to be carried away by distractions. " Then the leaders and nobles of Upper Mus said:

"If we settle in this place, we request to make a pledge not to harm birds, wild animals, or fish. " This lord replied, "If you keep your pledge, I will mostly stay here, though I will need to go to Ngor occasionally for blessings. " They suggested building a monastery, but when he had a dream about it, it said "No need for a monastery - it would be better to meet whatever comes naturally," so he said he wouldn't build one. However, Nam Loba offered timber from the old monastery of Lhotsa Menlung, and because they insisted, this monastery was built. He said, "The distractions of the monastery and assembly of monks caused harm to my spiritual practice. ".

Thus, it was solely due to this lord's kindness that all the birds, wild animals, and fish of Upper Mus were tamed and lived peacefully. Moreover, he regarded the masters from whom he received teachings on the Tripiṭaka as being like actual Buddhas, and he saw the masters from whom he received secret mantra teachings as actual Buddhas. Having completed his studies and training with the understanding that the teachings of secret mantra are comprised of the two aspects of ripening and liberation, he concluded elaborations through the view of the higher empowerments in his practice of Hevajra. In whatever tantric practice he undertook, he engaged in meditation according to the six general points as taught, and whatever mantra practice he did, he practiced it without deviating from the four ways of utilizing the path.

Then when Lord Ngorpa was seventy-five, in the Male Fire Mouse year, he became ill and came down. They met on the twenty-fourth day of the month of Saga, and when he made offerings led by much gold, he received the monastery's current instructions and the lord's final directives. Later, on the twenty-fifth, Lord Ngorpa passed away peacefully. Then for the three years of Mouse, Ox and Tiger, he took responsibility for Ngor monastery's seat, gave teachings, and successfully completed the extensive construction of the three supports (external and internal) without obstacles - this was due to the power of this lord's spiritual practice and the blessings of the previous lord, which everyone considered wondrous.

The details should be known from the biography of Lord Ngorpa composed by this lord himself. In the Tiger year, the great minister Norzang, king of law, invited this lord to Samdrub Tse. He requested empowerments of Amitāyus and Cakrasaṃvara.

After performing an extensive fire offering of Cakrasaṃvara, when he achieved excellent results in practicing the Kriyā tantra, Lord Kunpangpa remarked that such blessings were characteristic of Sakya masters. After that, he went to Upper Mus and established the hermitage called Yama Gönpa Deden Ritrö. This aligned with Lord Ngorpa's earlier prophecy about establishing Dewachen monastery, which indicated there would be two monasteries. Then, while maintaining his responsibilities at Ngor, he went north in the Hare year. In the third month of the Dragon year, he went into retreat at Samten Phug, primarily focusing on the approach practice of Kṛṣṇa Cakrasaṃvara along with fire offerings. That autumn, he stayed for eleven days at Lhundrup Ding, where he bestowed several empowerments including Hevajra and Cakrasaṃvara to the great Dharma king Namgyal Dragpa and his sons. Furthermore, he studied under more than thirty spiritual mentors, including the four successive abbots of Thang monastery where he had previously taken ordination, the great teachers from whom he received teachings on the great collections of the Tripiṭaka, and the preceptors and teachers who ordained him. The details of the inconceivable varieties of Dharma he received from them can be found in his own record of teachings received. In this way, all his studies and training were characterized by:
1. Resolving through listening
2. Perfecting through contemplation
3. Never separating from the experiential realization through meditation of what was learned and contemplated

By connecting study, contemplation, and practice, he was comparable to the great spiritual friend Öjowa. Moreover, he maintained without break the spiritual practices of the Nigu tradition of the primordial sky yogin.

Regarding his meditative experiences - when this master was young and living with his parents, it is said he would remain in clear samādhi for long periods. When he requested Chöd teachings from Lord Namkhapa, he developed great compassion for beings. Through the power of that strong compassion, when he generated bodhicitta, he developed an extraordinary bodhicitta accompanied by joy. Regarding the exchanging-self-and-others bodhicitta practice, he gained certainty thinking "This is exactly what is needed." The guru asked, "Did great compassion arise in you, master? You didn't even make a sound of weeping." When he replied that although compassion arose he couldn't make such sounds, [the guru] said "It's not good to suppress such experiences." He agreed, saying "Indeed, it's really not good to suppress such experiences."

When he rested in meditation on the view, the guru recognized that the nature of mind had dawned clearly for him and said "That has come to you, master" and did not question him repeatedly, though he would frequently question others. Later, he practiced the three stages of mind training, of which:
1. The first is merely giving and taking
2. The second is like scraping with a knife
3. The third is like the yogin of loving-kindness

He would think about taking on all faults and ripening them in himself. For instance, focusing on a leper, he would meditate on taking all their illness, pus and suffering and ripening it in himself. When he appeared exactly in the form of a leper, he felt great joy being completely free of self-cherishing.

In terms of relative bodhicitta, thinking "This alone is the supreme method for destroying self-grasping" generated great conviction. Also, when a supreme siddha called Blue Eye brought two prisoners bound together, compassion arose thinking "I should go in their place," and he wept for many days, feeling great distress. Also, when he stayed at Lay's small fortress for a long time, it is said he wept, and a monk named Tenpa Ödar saw him without being noticed. Furthermore, when this lord stayed at the upper reed hut of Ma, while his nephew Sherlo stayed below, a great rainfall occurred, and when [the nephew] went to see if any leaks had appeared, he found this lord with his upper garment removed, weeping, and being unable to say anything, he returned. Also, when staying at Taré Valley, seeing a female yak with a broken leg still nursing her calf, and after the mother died, the calf sometimes circling her corpse and sometimes preparing to follow the herd, this lord wept for a long time in the morning. His attendant Tashi Gyaltsen prostrated and repeatedly requested, "If you continue like this, it will harm your health through chest pain and such. "

Also, when staying together with Lama Rinchen Palzang, the uncle of nephew Sherlo, at Chiwa Valley, after the soup was ready to cook but much time had passed, when he went to look, this lord was sitting immovably in samādhi. He said this was the experience arising from the previously requested Nigu teachings. Also at Lho Tsamen Valley, while staying with Lama Chödrak and Zangyongpa during Lama Namlo's Chöd practice, this lord saw many fish in the water and developed immeasurable compassion.

For the sake of these beings, he said a special aspiration-bodhicitta arose, thinking "I must quickly attain enlightenment." 

Since Zangkyongpa had clear visions, he said that one night he saw Sakya Paṇḍita joining his palms in respect to this lord at the southern gate of Lho Tsa. Others say they saw this lord transform into four-armed Avalokiteśvara, to whom many Great Compassionate Ones were paying homage.

Furthermore, this lord performed approaching recitation of the six-syllable mantra nearly a hundred million times and continuously made prayers, through which he said Avalokiteśvara's blessings were great in pacifying obstacles and such. Once when traveling to Ngor for a year, he prayed to Avalokiteśvara for several days. In a dream one night, at the place called Dragon Cave in the rock of Lhasa where previously someone called the "Black Naked Yogi" had a vision of Avalokiteśvara, this lord also made many prostrations and devotions to the assembly of Avalokiteśvara deities.

Due to the power of his inner loving-kindness and immeasurable compassion, birds and wild animals would bow before him and listen to teachings like calves seeking their mothers. When some hunting dogs that had previously killed wild animals were offered to the lord and kept together as watch dogs, there were many reasons they dwelt in mutual love.

Also, when staying in a part of a wooden structure at Sinpo Valley, one night a rock fell and the structure collapsed. Though the lord's surroundings were filled with rock fragments, there was no harm to his body and his meditation remained undisturbed, it is said. At that time too, others say they saw him as Avalokiteśvara.

When Khenpo Namkha was asked about this lord's inner loving-kindness, he later said that at Penthang, a female beggar who was said to be a ḍākinī saw this lord as Avalokiteśvara. Also, when the official lady of Sepa invited him to Ngor, the one who invited him said they saw this lord as Vaiśravaṇa. Furthermore, Chudü Rabjampa Paldrub said he saw him as Rakta Yamāri.

When he previously received the Nigu teachings from Lord Namkha, he said special experiences arose like illusions that mixed dream appearances with daytime appearances. When he received mind training teachings at Ngulchu, one time while doing meditation practice at a certain rock cave, he saw all mountains and valleys as illusion-like. When friends called him for dinner and he went, wherever he placed his feet, the ground appeared shimmering like mercury. He said if he had maintained that experience, he would have been able to pass through walls and fences without obstruction.

Also, in the Ox year when his father passed away, at age forty-six, he stayed at the door of the Dewachen residence. While doing the practice of Hevajra, experiences arose of complete clarity without any ordinary thoughts. He said he realized "This is exactly the path that eliminates entering [into saṃsāra]." Having trained his mind through study, contemplation and meditation in this way, as for how he possessed the enlightened activities of the three qualities of being learned, disciplined and noble:

At all the great monastic seats - including those of this lord's great spiritual masters, the glorious Sakya, Dong, and Ngamring - this lord became renowned as an excellent teacher whose fame for mastery in all qualities of scriptural learning and realization spread in all directions.

Moreover, he possessed the treasury of explanations, practices, and instructions of all his spiritual mentors, and especially all the instructions of Lord Ngorpa. When he responded to questions asked successively by the Nyide Wönpo at Sakya, they said: "You are like Chöjung, the yogi of Dagpo. When people asked Lama Dagpo about each of the Six Dharmas of Nāropa - 'Who is skilled in this? Who is skilled in that?' - whatever was asked, he would say 'Chöjung knows this, Chöjung knows that.'"

In addition to becoming such a great scholar, regarding his qualities of monasticism, he remained as a great vajra-holding bhikṣu unstained by any downfalls of the three vows. Regarding monastic conduct according to the three sections of Vinaya: after taking ordination, for one full day and night he performed all the novice monk's activities in accordance with the Vinaya. After full ordination, he performed the immediate activities of a fully ordained monk such as poṣadha in accordance with the Vinaya.

In the Snake year, when this lord was fifty, he went to meet Chöje Gyalchogpa Jamchen when he was performing consecrations at Byang Ngamring. There, the teacher and disciples performed many novice and full ordinations. When this lord asked Chöje: "What is the reason for the difference between the poṣadha ritual practice performed earlier by Chöje Gyaltsabpa at Nyangtong and the ritual practice we teacher and disciples perform now?", he replied "I follow the ritual practice of Chöje Yagpa who performed poṣadha many times." When this lord took note of this.

Hearing this, [Chöje] asked: "Are you pleased that you did not follow Khangtso's tradition?"

Regarding his lifelong conduct, he was free from the four corruptions:

1. Being uncorrupted in livelihood, he was free from faults such as wrong livelihood. From his early days as a student, whatever tsampa he had, he would give to beggars and others. The lord himself sustained himself on mineral essences [sa rdo'i bcud len]. From the Monkey year when he was twenty-nine, he stayed exclusively at Ngor. Moreover, relying only on a small amount of food and tea, he never actively sought food and drink.

Looking at this, nowadays some monks who just skip dinner: eagerly and forcefully consume both hot and cold foods, actively seek only food and drink, and believing they are liberated just by skipping dinner, many are arrogant toward others while looking down on them. Although it appears that when monks become elderly, they become lax about maintaining practices like skipping dinner, this lord became even stricter than before.

Furthermore, this lord possessed the qualities of the Noble Sangha through the four excellent ways of proceeding:
1. Proceeding well
2. Proceeding properly 
3. Proceeding directly
4. Proceeding harmoniously

While we practitioners, as it is said "being improperly engaged, offerings are impure," enjoy only wrong livelihood.

2. Being uncorrupted in discipline means not being stained by even the smallest monastic infractions and not transgressing dharmic conduct through the four modes of going.

3. Being uncorrupted in view means thoroughly understanding the nature of all phenomena as explained in the definitive sūtras and tantras, and never being separated from applying this understanding to all appearances and sounds.

4. Being uncorrupted in conduct means spending time solely in dharma-concordant activities, never being separated from the four qualities that make one a śramaṇa, and conducting oneself without contradicting any of the eleven instructional advice teachings.

Furthermore, after being fully ordained for ten years, he became a great elder [gnas brtan] who possessed most of the twenty-one sets of five qualities of a preceptor. After taking the bodhisattva vows, he never separated from the conduct of the bodhisattvas and the practice of the three types of discipline. Regarding the characteristics of a Mahāyāna spiritual friend, it is said: "One who has the wisdom to abandon afflictions..." and

After entering the Vajrayāna, regarding the four great samayas of tantric conduct: he remained unstained by root and branch downfalls of the protection samaya; regarding the consumption samaya, he properly partook of the samaya substances both on special occasions and regularly as explained in the tantras; he properly maintained the inseparable samayas; and regarding the primary practice samaya, according to the unsurpassed [approach], he performed the practices of the generation and completion stages as his constant meditation day and night. When he became a qualified vessel as a student of secret mantra, as stated by glorious Candrakīrti: "One who is pure in discipline, learned and wise, and speaks well based on what they have heard is a jewel-like person. " He became a qualified vessel worthy of receiving teachings and explanations. Then in his forty-ninth year, the Dragon year, he did a thirteen-month retreat at Lhagong where he completed 1. 1 million recitations of the root mantra of the yidam Hevajra in one continuous session, performed fire offerings according to the condensed [ritual], and regularly performed four sessions daily without fail, reciting at least 100 root mantras in each session. Furthermore, having completed the approach and accomplishment practices of the three Cakrasaṃvaras, Yamāntaka, and other principal yidams to the prescribed extent, he could effortlessly accomplish either of the two types of siddhis. When practicing the approach of Hevajra and others, he would continue uninterruptedly from midnight until noon, and whatever approach practice he was doing, he would do it continuously until dusk. He said that he would complete other meditation practices in the early part of the night. Furthermore, having become a mahāsiddha for whom appearances, sounds and awareness arose as the three of deities, mantras and wisdom, he was unerring regarding the thirty or forty qualities of the vajra master. He became a great master of the Secret Mantra Vajrayāna, having mastered the instructions that distinguish the interpretable and definitive meaning of the tantras - the explanations of the seven ornaments, the explanations of the seven secrets, and the explanations of the six instructions.

In brief, he became a preceptor to a hundred thousand holders of Vinaya, a spiritual friend to a hundred thousand holders of Sūtra, and a guru to a hundred thousand holders of Tantra.

Regarding the third point, his excellent qualities: Whatever Dharma activities he performed, he practiced them endowed with the ten virtues and six perfections. He worked solely for the benefit of others through the four means of gathering disciples:

1. First, gathering through generosity for the sake of Dharma
2. Then, teaching the Dharma without error through pleasant speech
3. Through explanations that distinguished without mixing the common and uncommon aspects of whatever teachings he gave - whether of higher or lower vehicles, different philosophical traditions, or sūtra and tantra teachings
4. He engaged in all four means of gathering as explained in the scriptures

Furthermore, he took upon himself the suffering of all sentient beings while giving away his own happiness and virtue to all beings. As stated in the sūtra:
"Giving away head, hands and feet without hesitation,
Giving away all possessions without constant attachment,
Understanding phenomena's nature as selfless and illusory,
When giving even one's flesh without hesitation,
What need to mention giving external objects?"

These meanings were fully realized by this lord. Furthermore, regarding his excellent conduct: Although earlier Master Sangye Zangpo had said he should come to Ngamring, since Lord Ngorpa had not received a dream and the auspicious connections were not right, it was said he went to Ngamring following the Kachupa Kunga Döndrup. Later, when he (Kunga Döndrup) served as the throne-holder of Ngamring and requested "Please come now," he passed away in that situation.

Then in the Dragon year, while doing retreat at Samten Phug, when the lord insisted he must come and due to good dreams, he went to Ngamring in the summer of the Snake year. He gave empowerments and permissions to the lord and his sons, mind training teachings to the assembly, and a seven-month teaching of Lamdre. Then he returned. After that, in the Horse year, when the Ngor monks requested Khenchen Sherab Gyampa to take the throne seat, he came here for consultation. He prepared appointment letters and other documents. He also came once in winter and taught Dharma. In the winter of the Sheep year, he again went to Ngamring and stayed for seven months. Afterward, at Kyawo Khadang, he offered many material resources for cleaning and major repairs of Lord Sachen's reliquary stupa and Namgyal stupa. At one point, when the Great Lord in the north offered gold for the Kālacakra, he returned. He came for the consecration of a great statue and stayed for five days. Regarding the method of accomplishing the nectar pills: Previously, by Lord Ngorpa's words, "I think we should accomplish some nectar pills. At that time, invite some who have completed approaching practice from Mu. " However, it was not accomplished. Later, by the northern lord's words: "If that Lord Ngorpa had accomplished the nectar pills, it would have brought great benefit to beings, but he did not accomplish it. Now if you accomplish it, whatever conditions are needed, we will offer. "

When Ngari Namkha Yönten prepared the conditions and made earnest requests, he said he accomplished the pills at Samten Phug in the Monkey year. It is said that he stated it was an auspicious sign when he dreamed that all the foundations were filled with the golden dharma and consecrated.

In a dream while accomplishing the pills, he met with Lord Vīrūpa, who said there were no doubts about the dharma to be cut through. Also at that time, during his meditation experience at Samten Phug, he saw this land as a vast kingdom where all beings practiced dharma and were prosperous. Previously, the great lord had said, "It is good that this impure realm exists here for purifying buddha fields," but now that was not the case.

He said his mental continuum became more relaxed after that. At Chuzang Monastery, he stayed for two months. At night, through recitation of the hundred-syllable mantra, he completed 400,000 recitations. During the day, he practiced Lama Rinchen's meditation instructions. After that, he said he gained great understanding of the previous masters' writings. Again in the winter of the Dog year, he went to Ngamring and stayed for seven months. Thus, counting when the northern lord invited him to Lhundrub Deng, the three times he was invited to Ngamring, and when he came for the consecration of the golden statue, he was invited five times in total. Afterwards, it is said that when the great northern lord sent many medicines and provisions, he was asked to accomplish more pills. As for the third topic, concerning clairvoyance and many auspicious signs of benefiting others, and how he extensively benefited the teachings and beings through the three activities of teaching, debate and composition: From his youth, this lord performed many acts of clairvoyance.

When he received guidance from Namkha'i Nalnjorpa, the lord contemplated which rebirth his mother would take, and twice he had consistent visions about her taking a good rebirth. Later, after his father passed away, there were good dream omens indicating his father was protected from lower rebirths - from falling into precipices and rivers. However, he said it wasn't worth writing these down, so they weren't recorded. Also, when Geshé Sengé Drag had many doubts about the Sutra teachings, this lord knew about them and told him directly that such doubts would harm his practice. When Lama Chödrak Wönbo expressed his doubts and whatever activities he did before and after, this lord knew about them and told him directly. Furthermore, at Ngor, when the monks from Denma and Narthang met, someone called Maja spoke harshly. They couldn't clearly explain this to their teacher, and when someone who was unwell requested a protection cord examination, the lord became angry and didn't perform the examination. He said, "They have done something improper, so he won't recover," and just as he said, that person died after five days. Also, once when he was coming up from Ngor and was supposed to ride a horse from Mu, the lord said, "My horse has died, but it's fine to ride Poso's horse. " Later, when no one came from Mu, they said, "Our horse died. " The horse from Ngor took them to Bodong. There, Dolpa Poso Taglé's nephew had died and they were performing rituals in Bodong, so they offered a good horse from Poso for him to ride. There are many other accounts of his clairvoyance and stories of how he perceived beings in the bardo state, but since it would make the text too long, they were not written down.

Many of our monks and patrons requested dream interpretations and protection cord examinations according to their wishes, and all his predictions came true. Through blessed secret water and saliva alone, people and livestock were freed from illness. By drawing under the blessings of his hands and robes, and merely sprinkling grain mixed with his saliva among crops, epidemics and other inauspicious things were dispelled. When there was no rain for many days, just by moving slightly from his residence with the intention of making rain fall, whatever amount of rain desired would fall. In these and other ways, he benefited many beings.

Regarding signs of blessing by the yidam deities: When he agreed to give the Cakrasaṃvara Lohipa empowerment to four people including Master Namkha's representative Lama Phendewa and did the approach practice at Dzinglung, in this lord's dream, he dreamed that he drew a large Cakrasaṃvara maṇḍala that filled the entire surface. He said he had never drawn a sand maṇḍala before. When he reported this to Lord Ngorpa, he repeatedly said this was amazing. Also at that time, he said he saw eight women who were said to be the eight door guardians, and during the approach practice of Cakrasaṃvara Ghaṇṭapāda, he said there appeared empowerment vases and other things.

Regarding other auspicious signs of benefiting others: Lord Gyalchogpa, after teaching all the mind training teachings, said "Now I have transmitted these to the dharma holder, so teach them to others." Also, when meeting Lord Ngorpa at glorious Sakya, when two parasols appeared above this lord's head with many parasols emanating from them, Lord Ngorpa considered this an auspicious sign of great benefit to the teachings and beings, and subsequently granted him all the teachings. Also at Sakya, in the dream of the great Kache teacher of the Study College, Traralpa, Lord Ngorpa gave him a skull cup full of nectar, which this lord received and drank. Later it was said that he would maintain the Khön lineage, though while he accomplished vast benefit for beings in Kham, his life was short. The nectar that this lord received was a sign of holding the essence of the guru's instructions. When giving practice authorization at Sakya, Lord Ngorpa said: "Although no other signs and omens appeared, I clearly saw something like what was said about Lord Gö having eight principal disciples who were like pillars of the tantras, four heart disciples who were like great beams of instruction, and disciples skilled in ritual activities and enlightened action comparable to rafters and crossbeams." This was an auspicious sign indicating that this master and disciple would have that many disciples flourish. Also in Lord Ngorpa's dream, there was a spring said to be this lord's empowerment river. Near it were many of our monks including Master Köngyalwa. Köngyalwa covered the spring with his dharma robes saying "This is mine," claiming ownership. [Lord Ngorpa] said this indicated that the lineage of his empowerment river would come to Master Köngyalwa. The great Kache teacher Sangdrub is said to have heard this. Furthermore, when this lord came to Sakya, in Lord Zhönnu's dream...

When this lord came to Sakya, in Lord Zhönnu's dream, a high seat was arranged on the lord's right side. When asked who would come there, it was said that Nyen Phulchungwa would come. The next day when this lord arrived, it was heard that he said this lord was the reincarnation of Nyen Phulchungwa. Also one night in a dream, in what seemed to be Zhalu, three great Dharma thrones appeared. When asked whose they were, one was said to be Buton Rinpoche's, one was Lord Ngorpa's, and there was a great Dharma throne extending to the west which was said to be yours. Regarding the one extending northwest, it was said this seemed like [a sign that] although told to go to Ngari, he would not go. At Samten Phug also, there were accounts of how the Dharma thrones of the previous venerable masters and this lord appeared in dreams, and it was also heard that Siddha Chagzampa said this lord was the reincarnation of Kharag Gomchung. Furthermore, when Lord Ngorpa was about to depart to benefit others, while he was in strict retreat at Samten Phug focusing mainly on Guru Yoga practice, in a dream he saw Lord Ngorpa teaching Dharma to many monks at the edge of a mountain. When a herder appeared near that mountain, he became very concerned about what had happened and looked carefully. The previous scene disappeared and he saw Lord Ngorpa transformed into Hevajra in the form of Lake-born (Padmasambhava) sitting in the space in front. This lord himself was on a high mountain that was very pleasant and spacious with warm sunlight, teaching immeasurable Dharma for a long time in the midst of very many monks. It is said this was like when the previous lords departed to benefit others.

After that, this lord himself resided as the regent of the previous lord, which appeared as an omen that immeasurable benefit for others would come. Furthermore, when going to Nyenpo Monastery, he left his handprint on a rock. When he was invited to Ngamring in the north, it was said that if he went, he would benefit beings as much as Lord Gyalchogpa, according to a dream he had.

When he was in retreat at Samten Phug, he met Lord Sachen in a dream. Someone showed him a thangka of Manjushri, saying "This is the mandala where you received empowerment." When he looked at it, he said the main figure had four faces. Seeing what appeared to be Sachen's old worn boots, he was about to request blessings, but [Sachen] said "Those aren't mine" and transformed them.

Later, he dreamed of cleaning impurities from the Namgyal Dungbum (reliquary stupa). Also, he dreamed of what was said to be Siddha Dragphugpa's incense box gleaming with oil and many flowers, with some being larger than others. He said this seemed to indicate that the flowers represented the assembly of monks, and the larger flowers represented the great lineage holders.

In the Year of the Tiger when there was unrest in Central Tibet, when this lord was forty-seven years old and staying at Ngor, in a dream what was said to be Lord Gayadhara's vase water appeared on the mountain behind Lingka. When whitish water appeared, this lord made wings from his Dharma robes and flew to this side of Lingka. He said this seemed to indicate the later monastery and these great distractions regarding the Path with the Result teachings.

This monastery was established in the Year of the Snake, after the establishment of Nalanda. Previously when Lama Namchöpa was departing, he said "I am going to Sukhavati. You too will come to Sukhavati."

Also, while he was in meditation retreat at Dzinglung, in a dream he clearly saw Sukhavati, the pure realm of Amitabha, in the space above Chödar Monastery. In the sound-appearances it was proclaimed that "After this many years, you will come here." When adding those years to the previous ones, it appeared as an omen that would last until age 75.

Previously, Lama Namchöpa had said that if one practices the Aspiration Prayer of Good Conduct (Bhadracaryāpraṇidhāna) not just as mere words but with real meaning, one will definitely be born in Sukhavati. He saw that the lama who had practiced this as his meditation had indeed arrived in that pure realm, which accorded with his previous words.

Then this monastery was named Dewachen (Sukhavati), and since he made efforts to construct a representation of Sukhavati pure realm, it is certain that this lord will go to Sukhavati.

The hermitage of Samten Phug was also established when this lord was forty-seven, in the male Wood Dog year, and he practiced meditation there at times.

Furthermore, while staying at what is called Urgyen Guru's meditation cave "Dingrö," in a vision an old nun said: "Currently there aren't many students of Sakya Pandita.

He said there were only four or five [students] and that their survival depended solely on you. He said "Look at how now only about five descendants of glorious Sakya, like Namkha Gyaltsen and others, have received teachings from me. "

Also, he dreamed of ascending a mountainside at Lingkya carrying seven people. When resting from fatigue at the mountain top, he said it was similar to the great venerable one carrying seven people. When asked who those seven people were, he said their identities were uncertain. Also one night he dreamed of flying across three turquoise-colored rivers said to be the rivers of the three realms of existence, between Lingkye and Lamig. Also while residing at Ngor monastery, Lord Ngorpa appeared in a dream and said things would turn out well if he continued teaching Dharma as he was doing then. This shows he met with Lord Ngorpa many times. Along with such excellent signs of clairvoyance, the way he matured disciples and upheld the teachings through the three activities of teaching, debating and composition was: This lord previously matured many disciples through teaching Buddhist philosophy, and matured many disciples through meditation instruction. Before becoming the throne-holder of Ngor, he taught Dharma to many people during his travels. After becoming the throne-holder of Ngor, he satisfied disciples who came from all directions with many teachings and practices - even more than Lord Ngorpa. At Nyen monastery of Mu, he revived and gave ripening and liberation teachings on the Path with the Result teaching tradition. During his three visits to Ngamring in the north, he established many spiritual friends in mind training of Mahayana and the profound exposition and practice of the precious Path with the Result and other teachings. Although many great spiritual friends had visited that region before, there had not been anyone like this lord who established complete and unmixed practice of the stainless teaching tradition of exposition and practice.

From mainly Ngor monastery onwards until now, he taught Dharma to numerous disciples of high and low status. Among these were powerful patrons like the Dharma King Jangpa Dagpo and the King of Law Rinpung Norzang, as well as the unrivaled Sakya lineage holders on earth like Jamyangpa, Dagchen Zhithogpa, Dagchen Chumigpa, Dagchen Zhalupa, Dagchen Lodropa, and Sharpa Dagpo. Furthermore, he matured almost all those renowned as scholars in Central Tibet and Tsang these days through profound explanation and practice. 2. Regarding how he upheld the teachings through debate:
Through the power of his training in previous lives, as soon as he began his studies in this life, he developed great intelligence and confidence in debate. In particular, Lord Gyalchogpa would teach extensive lectures on valid cognition during the day and go to the debate courtyard in the evening. He would place good geshes and monks of different philosophical tenets on either side and have them debate each other. At the conclusion, it is said that he would say "Although such and such is claimed, this is how it actually is. " One night, when this lord debated with a monk named Lama Södgyal from Master Sangbumpa's students at Sangphu, there was a point about a negative phenomenon [ldog chos]. When this lord won, Lord Gyalchogpa looked at him and said "Ah! Master Köngyel said something like this would happen. I saw it through Jozang. " After that, he never spoke harshly to others.

In general, it was said that he had never sharply rebuked others during debates. When the Amdo monk Özer, who was a student of Lord Tsongkhapa and Lord Gyalchogpa, asked about a text on valid cognition that would be taught the next day (which he had not heard explained before), this lord composed a response. Though Özer said "Your estimation will become famous," it is said that he could not find any major faults. Moreover, when at Bodong, there was a master of the horse enclosure named Tsultrim Pel who, after circumambulating glorious Sangphu, looked down upon all the Bodongpas. When this lord visited Bodong, they requested, "Please engage him in debate. " When he was defeated in the debate, it is said that all the Bodongpas simultaneously removed their hats and made offerings. Furthermore, whenever anyone debated or questioned difficult points of sutra and tantra, he would reflect on those difficult points briefly and then completely explain their meaning to others, eliminating all doubts and misconceptions. For example, when hearing the term "the three vows of the Sakyapas transform into one essence," our own tradition's followers had not understood it properly and were confused, while followers of other traditions were hostile toward it and, lacking the fortune to analyze such excellent explanations, spoke various random talk. At that time, this lord, like one revealing treasures from underground, indicated "This is the intended meaning of the sutras and tantras," cutting through all nets of confusion from the root. Therefore, it is primarily due to this lord's kindness that the teachings of the "Differentiation of the Three Vows" remain without decline even today.

Having learned that in Tibet some later scholars altered all the practice arrangements of the earlier Indian and Tibetan masters regarding the profound system of Secret Mantra, they changed all the essential points of the profound mantrayana path through logical reasoning and claimed this as a great exposition. As it is written: "The profound essential points of the two stages, the ultimate path, not experienced before by others in this direction..."

For those with little understanding of Dharma history and especially those who do not know the essential points of Secret Mantra, even if faith arose in that system, the precious Lord Ngorpa refuted those later systems and firmly established only explanations and practice in accordance with the earlier Indian and Tibetan masters. This lord also kept this approach close to his heart and composed a text distinguishing the tantric philosophical systems of the earlier traditions and later assertions.

He established the earlier tradition through pure scripture and reasoning, while subjecting the later systems to a thunderbolt shower of pure scriptural citations and compelling logical arguments, thereby leading the holders of those systems to take up the discipline of shame. This can also be understood from what the master of reasoning, Gobo Rabjampa, wrote recording this lord's words. Thus, as stated in the praise: "Having sent down a thunderbolt shower of debate, I bow to the one who toppled the mountain of wrong views."

Following the text's flow and previous context, I'll translate the complete sentences:

Thus, the way this master and his spiritual sons were similar to Lord Atisha and his spiritual sons was this: Just as precious Dromtönpa later spread to others the profound essential points of Lord Atisha's mind's intention regarding Paramitayana practice, this lord made Lord Ngorpa's mind's intention regarding the profound essential points of Secret Mantra practice clear and extensive, ensuring they remain undeclined even today.

Furthermore, it appears that the inconceivably profound essential points of the inner meaning of the Unsurpassed Secret Mantra explanations were the exclusive domain of this lord alone. Since he did not permit them to be written down, they were not recorded.

Moreover, regarding his manner of possessing great intelligence in distinguishing philosophical systems of sutra and tantra and in refutation and proof, the great being Sakya Pandita stated that holy beings worthy of maintaining the teachings should possess these qualities:
1. Understanding the distinctions of words and meanings
2. Being skilled in the essential points of scripture and reasoning
3. Not being confused about the meaning of Paramitayana and Secret Mantra
4. Knowing how to practice the essential points of texts and instructions without contradiction
5. Discriminating between provisional and definitive meaning sutras
6. Comprehending without error the essential points of explicit and implicit intentions
7. Being learned in explaining both literal and non-literal expressions
8. Having wisdom that can properly discriminate meanings
9. Being free from attachment and aversion, remaining impartial
10. Being unspoiled by the demons of wrong philosophical views

These qualities exist only in this lord at present, whereas most contemporary Buddhist philosophical debates are conducted with attachment, aversion, and delusion, causing disturbance in all directions.

Moreover, this lord said that at Lord Ngorpa's place: "Though in Tibet there are many who claim 'I am learned' and on top of that, many who claim 'I am impartial,' such discrimination between earlier and later philosophical systems did not arise except from Lord Ngorpa, so this is one of Lord Ngorpa's most excellent qualities." Similarly, even today, though there are many who claim 'I am learned,' this lord's excellent quality was having unrivaled wisdom and compassion in distinguishing between what is Dharma and what is not.

3. Regarding his manner of composition: Whether composing major treatises or minor instructions, his works were concise in words yet vast in meaning, well-structured, pleasant to hear, and as it is said "good meaning in good words." These compositions, which exist in this lord's collected works, are treatises that are meaningful, eliminate suffering, and emphasize practice.

Regarding his way of effortlessly benefiting others: From earlier times until now, he never made things easy regarding empowerments, permissions, or full ordinations, but acted exactly as prescribed. In particular, even now at eighty-two years of age, even during the cold of winter, he gives path empowerments to more than five hundred people, performing the circulation of empowerment substances and so forth exactly as he did when young. Similarly with giving full ordinations to many. These are signs that he has achieved extraordinary accomplishment compared to others. Thus, whatever teachings he gave were solely intended as antidotes to afflictions when applied to one's inner mind. Therefore, many individuals devoted themselves solely to practice, having given up worldly concerns.

Therefore, having dedicated their lives solely to practice, many individuals, when taught a single mind training session of Mahayana, even those of unruly mind were established in peace and discipline. Furthermore, what need is there to mention establishing in liberation and awakening those monastics who have long followed him, when even those who merely requested a single teaching session or had a single audience with him could be ripened?

In this way, his giving of Dharma without self-concern to limitless disciples was like Lord Ngorpa, who taught Dharma solely to monks without self-concern, ultimately giving his life for the Dharma. He said, "I too had to do likewise, giving up my own spiritual practice and so forth, freely giving profound teachings to many people without hesitation regarding obstacles and the like." Thus, this lord also gave his life for the Dharma. As stated in the sutra: "Abandoning even life for the Dharma and striving in yoga - these should be known as the signs of non-regression," it is clear that he dwelt on the great level of non-regression.

In brief, not only was this lord definitely Vajradhara, but even in terms of ordinary appearances, he possessed what is called "body purified by the accumulation of discipline, speech purified by the accumulation of learning, and mind purified by the accumulation of wisdom." Moreover, according to the great venerable one's words: "Having definitively established freedom from extremes through non-dual mind, practicing this as unity is what establishes all paths of Vajrayana."

Thus, in all practices, this lord maintained his meditation without ever being moved by ordinary conceptual marks. Accordingly, when he reached the time when the body manifested as deity, speech manifested as mantra, and mind manifested as wisdom, even when he was sleeping, he would clearly recite the root mantra of Chakrasamvara and others.

He said that even earlier, when he was studying philosophical texts, he could recite texts and commentaries without error in his dreams. Moreover, whatever virtue he performed, he dedicated it solely for the benefit of others, saying: "Whatever offerings and tea services others make for my long life ceremonies, I dedicate all of these as causes for complete enlightenment for the benefit of others."

Whenever adverse conditions or afflictions of container and contents arose, he transformed adverse conditions into the path of enlightenment with joy, rather than being intolerant like ordinary people. He considered that these adverse conditions and sufferings arose from one's own negative karma conventionally, while ultimately they were without true existence, like illusions.

Whatever offerings were presented to him, he would offer them to the gurus and Three Jewels, or give them to Dharma practitioners and the destitute, without any attachment. Saying "Use all of these well without waste," he was a great siddha who viewed gold and stones equally and maintained equanimity toward friends and enemies.

Following the lord's instructions, the great nephew Sherlo also, maintaining little attachment to lamas and being generous with attendants, gave whatever wealth was available to the monastics of Ngor Monastery, Ngamring, and the upper and lower monasteries of this region through tea services, salt distributions, and monetary offerings.

Through regular offerings such as communal tea, salt distributions, and monetary gifts to the monastic assemblies of various monasteries, he particularly performed extensive rituals like the Namgyal Thousand Offerings every eighth day of each month for the master's long life ceremonies, providing abundant tea, food, and offerings to all the gathered monastics. From the labrang (lama's residence), he also sponsored extensive rituals for any monk who passed away, whether resident or visiting, and satisfied all the people of upper and lower Mus region. Furthermore, at various times he commissioned numerous representations of enlightened body, speech, and mind.

The master said: "One whose activities include unceasing Dharma giving and whose attendants engage in unceasing material generosity." Now the lord has reached eighty-two years, and the lord himself said: "In a dream one night in the Dragon Year, the lord of Ngor gave me what he said was a mala of Manidhara, saying 'This is your life span.' According to that, it seems I will remain for several more years." Just as he said this, we pray that he remains in this realm for a long time for the benefit of the teachings and beings.

I have written this brief biography of the venerable master based on the lord's own words and the accounts of his pure-vowed disciples who attended him for a long time. The things reported as "he said" or "I heard" were heard directly from his speech by those who attended him.

Through various orderings of age references, I primarily focused on what was most appropriate to convey. Though the lord's qualities are unfathomably deep and I am of little intelligence and lack poetic composition skills, I have written this brief account just to see some benefit for myself and others. Whatever virtue has been accumulated through this and other virtuous deeds,

I pray that by properly maintaining the guru's biography and definitely receiving the guru's blessings, I may be born in the guru's presence in all future lives. May all who requested this, those connected to it, and all who composed it accomplish all their wishes of this and future lives.

This biography based on the spoken words of the venerable great being Konchog Gyaltsen Palzang was written, at the request of many spiritual friends and with assistance from the great nephew Sherlo and others who attended the lord for a long time, by Gungru Sherab Zangpo, who has taken the lord's foot-dust upon his crown. It was composed at Dewa Chen Monastery in Upper Mus on the twenty-third day of the black month in the female Earth Ox year, when the lord was eighty-two years old. May this benefit many teachings and beings.

From here onwards, Sherab Gyatso's biography was not found.

The Precious Garland: A Biography of the Glorious Supreme Lama Kunga Wangchuk
By Sonam Lhundrup

Homage to the Guru! I bow down and take refuge in the stainless lotus feet of the supreme holy lama.

Your body, adorned with the major and minor marks of excellence, is like nectar for the eyes of all beings who delight in its variegated patterns. Your speech, with the melody of Brahma, is the lord of expression teaching limitless scriptural traditions to beings without obstruction. Your mind plays in the supreme essence of innate joy, having attained unforgetting retention. I bow to you who accomplishes all purposes of disciples through the inconceivable enlightened activities of all Buddhas displayed as illusory dance.

May that supreme being, crown ornament of the three realms like Ishvara, protect me - you who see all phenomena with the power of wisdom, you who are the great bliss of highest joy, the wisdom mother of selflessness.

You are the sun illuminating all oceans of knowledge, the lord of night who brings joy to many scholars. Supreme lord of yogis, jewel crown of siddhas - I bow to you, wish-fulfilling tree.

From the vast and deep ocean of your life story, I will string together like a garland just a few jewel-like qualities, having cleaned them with the pure Ganges-like flow of my intention.

Here, our guide, lord of the three realms and guru of beings, great sun of wisdom directly revealing the true nature of knowable things, precious source increasing the enlightened activities of self and others, adamantine nature demolishing the mountain of identity-view, Dharma king protecting those with faith in the Buddha's teachings, majestic lion terrifying and subduing the deer-like evil opponents of self and others, great being supreme in distinguishing Dharma from non-Dharma, eldest son of the noble beings, captain leading desired ones to the precious island of the Sugatas, glory of all beings, island of excellence, crown jewel of scholars - this holy lord known as Kunga Wangchuk, though definitely being Great Vajradhara himself, in the perception of ordinary beings...

Among ordinary beings, having taken birth among humans, he displayed many enlightened activities. When speaking of his biography in accordance with common perception, there are: 1. The deeds of the Form Body, 2. The deeds of the Dharma Body, and 3. The continuous turning of the wheel of enlightened activities.

Regarding the first, there are two parts: 1. Before becoming ordained, and 2. After becoming ordained.

Regarding the first: His family lineage was called Chokro of Dri-tsham, similar to the Precious Lord. His ancestors came from Dri-tsham to the Sakya region. They lived as nomads in places like Gara. Gradually, they became the food stewards for the precious lineage holders and the eastern labrang, continuing for more than ten generations.

In particular, this great being's father was the food steward of Dharma Lord Sharpa Yeshe Gyaltsen, named Drungchen Delek, who had pure discernment and great affection for him. Since Drungchen's wife, the noblewoman Genyenma, had no son, this lord's mother was Palden Zangmo, known as the "Seen Nun of Mus." Thus, he said that since the noblewoman Genyenma showed him great love and affection, she was very kind to him.

In the Female Water Hare year, when he entered the womb, his mother experienced signs similar to those that occurred when great bodhisattvas entered the womb. She experienced no harm and became naturally gentle and peaceful in disposition.

In the Male Wood Dragon year, he was born accompanied by many wonderful signs.

In the same year that the great lord bodhisattva Shakya Zangpo went to Kubum to receive teachings, he was born. When he reached six or seven years of age, he was given the name Genyen Kunga Dondrub. At Kyelas Monastery, under master Palden Dondrub, he completed his studies in common sciences such as reading and writing.

At that time, being a small child, when there was no caretaker at Khau temple, he stayed inside. At the place where Four-Faced Mahākāla actually dissolved, there was a small door sealed with the high masters' seal. He broke it and looked inside. There was a stone mandala and a lot of barley, but nothing else like statues. Whether it was due to the thoughtless actions of children or past karmic connections, there were no negative repercussions. While others were frightened, from that time on, it appeared that special dharma protectors followed him.

2. The liberation story of becoming ordained has three parts:
1. Being bound by precious training
2. Increasing hearing, contemplation, and meditation
3. The way of attaining special qualities

Regarding the first: At age twelve, in the Female Wood Hare year, at the eastern labrang of the glorious great seat of Sakya, the great Vajradhara Lord Kunga Zangpo acted as abbot and Jangchuk Kunga Lekpa acted as master, and he was ordained. He was given the name Kunga Wangchuk. Then Dharma Lord Jangchukpa took him to Jangchuk.

Then Dharma Lord Jangchukpa took him to Jangchuk, where he thoroughly trained in the texts of the three Hevajra tantras. He said that the textual materials of that time were the name of the precious Āryapa, the General Analysis [spyi rnam], the Brief Purification [dag chung], and the Brief Tree [ljon chung]. In particular, he recited the root tantra hundreds of times. It is said that even today, there exists a remarkable small hermitage from that time, blessed with spiritual power.

Since these tantras are extremely sacred teachings, there is no tradition of studying them casually. The earlier Sakyapas would make torma offerings without fail when holding the lineage transmission. He said, "I too made torma offerings without fail when receiving the lineage transmission at Jangchuk."

Then in his fifteenth year, the Male Earth Horse year, he went to the glorious E-wam Chöden, source of numerous precious qualities. He attended closely to the precious Dharma Lord and received various teachings of the holy Dharma. Primarily, he pleased the holy lama through his conduct and undertook countless inner and outer tasks with great effort. For a long time, he also tended to the dzo (female yak-cow hybrid) that provided the Precious Lord's milk.

During such a time, when Dharma Lord Paṇḍita was staying with the Lord, he came to make prostrations to the lama after finishing tending the dzo, with a small stone wrapped in his waistcloth. Just as he was leaving, the lama said, "This one will be the holder of our seat in the future."

At such a time, when Dharma Lord Paṇḍita was staying with the Lord, this master went to make prostrations to the lama after tending the dzo, with a small stone wrapped in his waist. Just as he was leaving, the lama said, "This one will be the holder of our seat in the future." When asked, "Then shall I also become a seat holder?", he replied "Be quiet, it won't be you. It will be him." It is said that this was the lama's prescient vision from that early time.

At that time, he presented to the Lord his own well-painted miniature paintings [tsa ka li] of the six manifestations of Virūpa, the three father-son great Sakyapas, and the two uncle-nephew Dharma Lords, each colored with gold. The Lord said, "These are very auspicious signs. They indicate that there will be about six seat holders blessed by the Lord of Yogis and about five seat holders blessed by the great Sakyapa father and sons. Place these behind the portraits [lder sku] of the Path and Result lineage." And so they were placed there.

Without doubt, this lama was blessed in the lineage by the Lord of Yogis Virūpa. He said, "All of you should meditate on this lama's form exactly as it appears, either at the crown of your head or in the center of your heart. This will be equivalent to meditating on Virūpa."

In his twenty-seventh year, the Horse year, with the Lord of Wisdom Kunga Zangpo as preceptor, Muchen Konchok Gyaltsen as karma master, the great bodhisattva Sonam Gyaltsen as secret preceptor, and the great accomplished one Namkha Palzang as time-keeper, he received full ordination as a bhikṣu in the midst of an ocean-like assembly of monks. He beautified himself with the aggregate of ethical discipline and maintained even the most subtle aspects of the training like protecting his eyeball.

Needless to say regarding major downfalls, it was directly evident that he was unstained even by the slightest minor infractions. For this reason, wherever he stayed, all directions of that place became pure and pleasant. Also, it was proven through experience that everything that touched his body - his robes, seat cushions and so forth - became endowed with excellent fragrance. Once, when he was in an ordination assembly where he had performed many full ordinations, at the time of distributing flowers, an unprecedented fragrance was sensed that could not be compared to any worldly sandalwood, agarwood, or other precious scents. This was certainly the fragrance of this great being's ethical discipline.

Previously, there was a disciple of the brahmin Paramārtha named Ratnadvīpa Sukravajra who was supreme among the most disciplined. The fragrance of his ethical discipline could be sensed from a distance of five hundred arm-lengths. The dharma protectors declared, "Because your discipline is completely pure, we will protect you and never separate from you for even a moment - this is our commitment." It is renowned that he accomplished whatever they commanded without obstruction and thus greatly benefited the teachings. It is understood that this lord possessed an equivalent liberation story.

Thus, with certainty in arising exactly as taught in the Vinaya Piṭaka regarding the training in higher ethical discipline, his mindstream was well-trained as he became a source of precious qualities.

The bodhisattva vows, being rooted in great compassion, this son of the victors from the very beginning possessed the natural disposition of striving to benefit all beings as if they were his only child. Because he could bear the great burden of being devoted to the welfare of infinite sentient beings and possessed the nature of patience that could not be disturbed by various wrong practices of others, although he was certainly a great being, to make this even clearer, in accordance with the ritual traditions stemming from the two great pioneers of the Madhyamaka and Cittamātra traditions, he properly received and internalized the bodhisattva vows from the great Lord Vajradhara himself. In accordance with the liberation stories of the noble ones dwelling on the great levels, there was not even a moment when any activity of his body, speech, and mind did not work for the benefit of others. Regarding the vidyādhara vows, having received the unmistaken empowerments and being rooted in the two lower vows, he properly received the undiminished stream of empowerments from the great Vajradhara himself, the lord of all families who perfectly possessed all the characteristics taught in the tantras. Without wavering even slightly from ordinary conceptual thoughts, having blessed the mandala of the appearances of the three vajras of body, speech, and mind, having transformed into the nature of deities and wisdom, he spent his time solely in the appearances of complete purity without even the slightest doubt or uncertainty.

These were heard along with the minor annotations from Sachen onwards. Other numerous dharma cycles related to Hevajra that were heard are not written here as they are limitless.

The complete hearing of the Kangyur, Sakya Kabum, great Vajradhara's collected works, Mahāsattva's complete collected works, Three Red Cycles, two major and minor Dharma protectors, Hundred Sādhanas, Ocean [collection] and others should be understood according to the separate hearing record.

4. Regarding the transmission of explanations:
The three Hevajra tantras, root and explanatory tantras of Cakrasaṃvara, Mahāmāyā, root tantra of Guhyasamāja, Seven Chapters of Yamāntaka, Tantra of Purifying Lower Realms, consecration tantra, Vijaya chapters, longevity dhāraṇī of Amitāyus and numerous other tantras, along with countless explanatory works composed by previous gurus related to these were heard.

5. Regarding the hearing of instructions:

The five stages of Guhyasamāja according to Ārya tradition along with branches, and the completion stage "Drop of Liberation" according to Jñānapāda tradition, and the extremely unelaborate completion stage of Red Yamāntaka, and the four stages of Cakrasaṃvara, and the five stages, and the guidance of White Cakrasaṃvara, and the extremely unelaborate guidance of Mahāmāyā, and the guidance on completion stage of Ocean of Ḍākinīs, and the famous Six Yogas of Śavaripa and many others were heard.

In particular, he heard the precious teaching of the lord of yogis, the Path with its Result, as experiential guidance about fifteen times, and what is recorded in the catalog of volumes, and all remaining parts of the Path cycles, and all instructions including additional branches and supplementary teachings were thoroughly heard and mastered.

The way these were heard should be seen in that lord's hearing record.

6. Regarding the cycle of miscellaneous instructions:
The cycle of fierce dharma of Lesser Virūpa, and the cycle of hā visualization of Kobrakpa, and the Indian text of stick dharma of Guṇamitra with its history, the root text of Virūpa's immortal yogic exercises, its condensed meaning composed by Kunpangpa, the yogic exercises composed by Puṇyadhvaja, the five armor protections, the twenty-five body trainings of Glan, the eight Śāradās and others were heard.

From the Great Being, he heard the five meanings of the tantra of essence extraction of Ever-Weeping according to the lineage from Lotsāwa Rigpé Gyalpo and Muchen Namkhai Naljor, and the history of Indian Vajreśvara composed by Nyongrong Tsepang, and the thirteen chapters on how to rely on Ever-Weeping along with application methods and a little more, and from Dungtsho Repa's lineage, the methods for examining sand, methods for eating, obstacle removal and benefits compiled together.

From Jamyang Sherab Gyatso, he received:
1. The praise to Sugata by Jetsun Drakpa Gyaltsen and Chöje Sakya Paṇḍita
2. Two praises:
   2.1. Praise to Phakpa Rinpoche by Lakṣika
   2.2. Praise to Glorious Lama Dampa by Vīraka
3. The sādhana of Nāgarāja composed by Nāgārjuna, translated by Rinchen Zangpo
4. The guidance on the five-fold Mahāmudrā
5. The direct guidance on the Great Compassionate One
6. The transmission of its instruction manual composed by Rinchen Sherab Bum
7. The dhāraṇī of blue-robed Vajrapāṇi
8. The transmission of the text translated by Khön Luwang Sungwa and many others

Furthermore, what he heard was not merely words but he thoroughly comprehended their meaning, and for each category of teachings, he accurately taught them along with their unbroken lineage sources. During those occasions, his study of the scriptural works was also inconceivable. While most Tibetan spiritual friends claimed to have broad knowledge just by looking at Chöje Butön's hearing record, the scope of Lord Vajradhara's study was unprecedented in Tibet. He said that he had completed one full reading and half of another reading of all the master's texts. According to an old catalog, there were over seven hundred volumes in the residence. He clearly remembered in his mind each text he had studied.

Having spoken about the sources of even the most minor scriptural references with precise citations of where they could be found, this was truly amazing. Although he engaged in extensive study and contemplation, he remained unwavering in a single stream of meditative concentration, spending day and night continuously in profound yogic practice - this is difficult for ordinary people to fathom. In the third general topic concerning how he attained extraordinary qualities: Although his complete biography is beyond our comprehension, it is certain that he achieved great stability in the meditative concentrations of the two stages primarily through dedication to practice. This is known because he directly stated during one occasion while in residence: "From the moment I first entered Vajradhara's dharma court, I gained firm certainty that all appearances are deity and wisdom. "

Regarding his teaching style: Rather than explaining various words and letters according to his own understanding, he said "When teaching while holding the scriptures of the previous guru-buddhas, there are no errors even in the words, and there is a great difference in comprehending their profound meaning. " He gave extensive and thorough explanations of the texts of the previous venerable masters, teaching in a way that led all dharmas he taught to converge with and flow into definitive meaning. As stated in the Secret Chapter of the Tathāgata: "Whatever dharmas one has heard, one teaches them extensively and perfectly to others with a mind free from material concerns, without hoping for respect or verses of praise. ".

He would not teach dharma to others merely following his own words. As it accords well with the meaning of the statement "One teaches dharma to others exactly as one has heard and experienced it," the Lord himself said: "There is no purpose in studying and explaining others' texts while eating one's own food without connection [to practice], and it is difficult for that to become dharma. The dharma to be practiced must have the characteristics explained by Chöje Sakya Paṇḍita in the Noble Path of the Bodhisattvas" - this appears extremely wonderful. Therefore, in terms of both text and meaning, his way of explanation was to uphold the perfect liberation of the Omniscient One's speech. Thus, all the learned beings of his time would place his feet upon their crown and, untying their knots of pride, enjoyed the dharma festival. He made countless noble beings into disciples. Regarding his composition of texts: Although he primarily focused on benefiting others rather than emphasizing poetic meter, he nevertheless composed poetry that captivated the minds of scholars. In his compositions such as the wish-fulfilling jewel ritual of the Path and Time, praises to the earlier gurus, and miscellaneous songs of experience

In his compositions, there are only those that captivate the minds of prosody experts. When others debated and questioned him, his dharma-consistent responses demonstrated unobstructed confidence, dispelling others' misconceptions through reasoning and scripture. Even great logicians who were confused about aspects of grammar would be thrilled with amazement.

Furthermore, regarding his devotion to the guru: He had absolutely no doubt or uncertainty that the lord guru and his spiritual sons were definitely Vajradhara himself. Through that power, the blessings of the gurus entered his mindstream, and he gained mastery over ocean-like outer and inner qualities, with all enlightened activities spontaneously accomplished.

From the Female Water Sheep year until the Male Wood Monkey year, he performed the basic approach practice of Hevajra Yab-Yum along with the concluding fire offering ritual, without taking on the burden of the monastery seat. At that time, there were signs of blessing from the yidam deities and inconceivable pure visions, though these are not described in detail.

When he was preparing to visit the great bodhisattva in the Female Wood Bird year, the venerable Mahāvajradhara appeared in a dream, offering an excellent bilva fruit and making this auspicious verse:
"May this auspiciousness of
The dharma of cause, conditions, and result like the bilva,
All worldly and transcendent conduct,
And the supreme essence of enlightenment
Accomplish all purposes!"

After arriving at E-waṃ monastery, all the collections of qualities matching the auspicious verse manifested. Although there appear and are realized some other extraordinary aspects, I dare not express them here.

Furthermore, when he previously went to Ngari, he excellently bestowed explanations of the root tantra and instructions on the precious teaching of the Path with its Result (Lamdre) along with its fruition.

Having previously visited, he excellently bestowed explanations of the root tantra and instructions on the precious teaching of the Path with its Result (Lamdre). He ripened countless supreme spiritual friends and great patrons of the teachings through the path of Vajrayāna. He granted the supreme bodhicitta to ordinary gatherings many times, establishing them on the Mahāyāna path. Furthermore, he served as preceptor for more than a thousand monks' ordinations, extensively spreading the fundamental teaching of the higher training in ethics. During that time, when inconceivable offerings came from patrons of the dharma and disciples, he offered them to the two previous living gurus and only used them for special occasions like commemorative offerings to the previous masters, without having even the slightest sense of personal ownership. When he went to meet the great bodhisattva at Mukyi Lingkhar, it is said that merely seeing his face generated countless samādhis in their mindstream, and they remained in meditative equipoise there for a long time. After arriving at E-waṃ, he satisfied numerous fortunate beings through teaching countless dharma doors including empowerments, explanations, blessings, transmissions, pith instructions, and guidance. It is said that he gave approximately seventeen complete cycles of the Path with its Result teachings and more than twenty proper explanations of the tantras.

Having been too numerous to mention, and once again considering the great patrons and disciples of the teachings in Ngari, he arrived at the great dharma college of Glorious Byampa Ling. In that autumn of the Bird year, he gave an extremely extensive and thorough explanation of the Precious Abhisamaya Tree and the commentary on the Praise of Selflessness [Nairātmyā-stuti]. Although he intended to teach the root tantra Hevajra in Two Sections, due to the capability of the petitioners, he gave detailed teachings on the Hevajra root tantra based on Dīpaṃkara's Pearl Garland, and teachings on the Yoginī Universal Practice Tantra from the throne of the Venerable One, along with detailed explanations of Lūhipa's Indian texts.

Then, drawn by the fragrant reputation and fame of the Lord himself, a gathering of around nine hundred disciples from the three regions of Ngari assembled like geese to a lotus lake. When they single-pointedly requested the precious teaching of the Path with its Result, the guru himself said, "When the great Dharma Lord Muspa came to Ngamring for the later dharma cycle, about eight hundred people came to hear the Path with its Result. At that time, I dreamed that all the grounds in front of Ngamring monastery were filled with many small yellow flowers. He said this might mean the continuity of benefit would not last long. However, since there are now many who are well-versed in the tantric teachings and many who listen with great aspiration, it seems the benefit to the continuity of the teachings will be greater this time." He appeared to rejoice in this. Then in the tenth month, he began the Path with its Result teachings.

During the month of Saga Dawa, he gave detailed, extensive, and complete cycles of instructional teachings. He ripened and liberated countless fortunate disciples through the path of Vajrayāna. Furthermore, he bestowed the supreme bodhicitta vow to gatherings of more than a thousand people, and established over a thousand ordained ones including bhikṣus and śrāmaṇeras. Regarding establishing fortunate disciples simultaneously in the practice of all three vows, it seems there has been none superior to this lord. During such extensive turning of the wheel of dharma, many wondrous signs were witnessed by all, such as great earthquakes, sounds heard in all directions, and everything pervaded by sweet fragrance.

2. Regarding how he demonstrated the activities of the dharmakāya, I will speak according to the words of the supreme regent, the heart son of the venerable guru. Although this precious dharma lord merely appeared to take on a form for the sake of disciples, he had mastery over birth, death and so forth. Apart from his own uncertainties, when later examining the prophecies and such, it appears he had intended to work for others' benefit from early on. He made great effort in giving dharma teachings, gave uninterrupted great dharma gatherings, and before beginning the Speech Instructions said "I will soon begin this Path with its Result. My father will also die this year. I am happy there will be no obstacles for any teacher or student during the Path with its Result."

During the Path with its Result teaching period, he rejoiced that there would be no obstacles for any teacher or student. He spontaneously gave instructions to make aspirational prayers focused on this. For the causal empowerments, he would give the preparations each day and complete the main part twice, while also giving various minor dharma teachings in between, working without rest like a ferry boat. As the months grew colder and the crowds grew larger, there were concerns that giving so many teachings might harm his health. Though such requests were made, he kept his earlier commitment in mind and did not accept the requests, while the gatherings continued to grow.

Since there were many who earnestly sought the dharma, he said there was a risk that some sincere seekers might not receive it. For practices like the profound Guru Yoga, the blessing of Nairātmyā, and the authorization of Mahākāla and Consort and the Eight Deities, it was not customary to give these to more than three, five, or seven people. He said that unless the common Guru Yoga and the authorization of Mahākāla from the Hundred Sādhanas were given to everyone in the assembly, there was a risk they wouldn't grasp them. Additionally, for various important matters requiring attention from the lord that were in accordance with dharma - when certain lamas, teachers, and officials were lazy or procrastinating, the lord himself repeatedly urged and encouraged them as if specially appointed until they accomplished their tasks. From the eleventh day of the Snron month until the twenty-sixth, the general assembly of Byamling had an ongoing practice ceremony.

They had previously performed their regular practice ceremony only in the Sagadawa month. This year, since the officials' calendar calculations added an intercalary month and would hold it in the later Sagadawa month, it seemed this would coincide with when the dharma teachings were scheduled. When asked if it would be appropriate to perform it during this current practice period, [he replied] that generally one should not postpone or reschedule guru commemoration ceremonies. "This is the actual Sagadawa month. Even though the officials have added an intercalary month, we will observe it this month. You may also continue the practice ceremony as long as you are able." He gave many such wise and thoughtful instructions.

From the twelfth to the fifteenth of that month, he went into a brief retreat. From the sixteenth through the nineteenth, he gave the profound blessing of Guru Yoga and other extremely profound instructions to a small group of worthy vessels in a very extensive and thorough manner with great emphasis. He also completed various minor dharma teachings he had agreed to give, as well as most of the remaining instructions and transmissions from previous teaching sessions. During this time, there was not even the slightest manifestation of illness or fatigue.

On the twentieth, he experienced some slight discomfort. A regular physician who had been giving medicinal preparations and treatments earlier said, "There seems to be a somewhat high fever, but there are no concerning pulse signs or other symptoms of illness. I will offer some medicine that will help with this fever." Although the lord himself was generally someone who took a great amount of medicine, he said medicines were unnecessary and combining ineffective medicines...

would be unnecessary, as combining medicines would be troublesome and ineffective," he said.

Due to his remaining strength, as he was not experiencing much physical weakness, those attending him felt no anxiety. Until teatime, they engaged in mutual discussions about Dharma and regularly asked the lord to resolve their doubts.

After tea was finished, his condition became slightly worse. Although he said "Those who have been attending the teachings these past few days should gather immediately after lunch to continue the remaining teachings," it seemed impossible not to decline.

Thinking it might be tolerable to complete the small remaining portion of the previous day's profound path instructions, when it was mentioned "Since your condition is worse today, it might be better to postpone it for today, and they have also made such arrangements," he replied, "They are only concerned about not receiving the teachings, they have no other objections. You have cut off their stream of Dharma." He showed great signs of being unable to bear it.

After a little while, he said "Since my physical strength is low today, that postponement does indeed seem appropriate." During the later period, his strength appeared to diminish more and more.

He said "Since I won't be calling anyone for evening tea gatherings and such today, prepare the torma offerings now and do the torma dedication now." He performed these earlier than usual. He applied greater effort than usual in his regular practices, and showed great signs of being unable to bear others leaving his presence and of feeling unsatisfied.

After completing his prayers and moving to his seat on the bed, he spontaneously proclaimed:

Saying "OṂ namo vajrāsane ajite aparājite vaśaṃkarinetra bhāmaniye", he clearly recited about half of the mantra sequence. It seemed I could also recite along with him, as if it was present in my mind. Although there was clarity about the consecration, it seemed like this was present, but later even though I thought about it, I couldn't be certain exactly what it was.

After a while, he asked "Is the one calling me Akṣobhya?" When I was unable to offer a response, he said "I understand."

Up until this point, aside from these matters, there were no other major proclamations. Then, showing signs of being unable to bear it, he displayed great signs of displeasure and dissatisfaction toward the few attendants present. He repeatedly said "Everyone should leave separately."

While others waited briefly in the outer courtyard, when I alone remained with him, he displayed numerous very strong changes in expression and demeanor, making me wonder what might happen. When I suggested "Perhaps it would be good to turn your seat to face east," he replied "That won't do. I must face west. The holy gurus reside in Sukhāvatī. I hope to reach there."

Although there seemed to be something like this statement, thinking it might not be appropriate to make an immediate request, I hesitated somewhat. Since there was no clear directive, when I asked "Is it Sukhāvatī?" he said "Yes, yes" with joy. From then on, he sat facing Sukhāvatī. At this point, ordinary conceptual thoughts largely subsided and he remained solely in pure appearance.

When anyone suddenly touched his body or made requests into his ear, besides one or two reply words, not a single ordinary command or word emerged. Around midnight, he repeatedly spoke of experiencing great bliss in his mind-stream, saying without interruption: "Joy, bliss, unchanging, stainless. " He made many hand gestures. After brief intervals, he spoke connected sequences of names like "unceasing buddha-nature, great bliss, buddha wisdom. "

At dawn, gazing intently into the southern sky, after a while he said he saw the vajra palace and Heruka. He also spoke countless things like "ḍākinī, ḍākinī" and so forth, suggesting he had extraordinary visions beyond imagination. Up until then, his body remained at ease, making various hand gestures and verbal expressions. However, around sunrise on the twenty-first, he assumed the bodhisattva cross-legged posture with hands in meditation mudra, ceased all speech, and remained in one-pointed concentration. When requested to stay through the evening, and when asked slightly about the reasons, not much else emerged. He said, "I don't know if I will die. Even if I die, I have not even a particle of attachment or clinging to mind. I am doing something like transference, making pure aspirations. " As he said this, after the fever emerged, through the instructions for the time of death and while making pure aspirations, he undoubtedly departed for Sukhāvatī. At that time, divine flowers, fragrances, and musical sounds manifested even to ordinary people.

As a sign of his previous departure for the benefit of others, many wondrous omens appeared that were witnessed by all: the earth trembling, sounds reverberating, various birds abandoning their own calls and making different sounds, and various extraordinary dreams experienced by different people, which became objects of wonder. Some also reported witnessing non-human beings circumambulating the temple where his remains were kept. At the shrine housing his remains, there appeared slight signs of constant presence in the form of putra and other caretakers. When his remains were cremated, rainbows and sweet fragrances pervaded all directions. When the reliquary was opened and his complete skull emerged, it was beautifully adorned with various designs, and inconceivable multicolored relics emerged. These wondrous signs were displayed and produced to generate certainty about the dharma lineages and tenets in future disciples, and to increase the merit of disciples through his actual form. Most of his other inexpressible deeds remain in the ears of his direct disciples and clear in their minds. Regarding the third general topic, the way in which the wheel of enlightened activity continues uninterruptedly: Even in this region, with the great patrons of the dharma taking the lead and faithful disciples constructing and practicing with numerous sand mandalas as taught in the profound tantras, making continuous offerings, and [establishing] the sangha of bhikṣus...

Through service and offerings to an assembly of tens of thousands including the sangha of bhikṣus and gatherings of people, accomplishing inconceivable arrays of offerings and distributions, and without interruption establishing representations of body - the complete lineage of Lamdre gurus; of speech - the Sakya Kabum; and of mind - the great enlightenment stupa and others.

After his sacred remains arrived at Ewam Monastery, these were perfectly established without effort or any harm: an image of Buddha Amitābha thirteen cubits tall with a gandhola, a life-sized statue at his residence, a hand-span sized statue supplementing the profound path lineage, and atop these a hand-span sized statue of Vajradhara, and an outer support equal in measure to those of the previous masters. This was due to his compassion. Furthermore, through the blessings of the Lord of Yogis, holy beings who were both learned and accomplished maintained the seat for a long time and worked for the benefit of beings for as long as saṃsāra exists - this too arose from the enlightened activity of this supreme noble one.

The virtuous qualities of the learned, disciplined Lhawang Kunga being unequaled and extremely rare in existence, how could one like myself in this final age fully understand them? Let there be no pride from this small account. Through the wonderful words of the Lord Buddha himself, may the clear-minded fortunate ones of the beginning be satisfied, and may the words taught by babblers be separated from pleasing thoughts. From single-pointed contemplation thinking about the meaning of this...

From single-pointed contemplation on the meaning of this, having easily attained the level of perfected qualities and the stages of supreme joy, and having obtained the wealth of the extraordinary guru's speech - therefore, in each and every birth, I respectfully place the garland of your two lotus feet upon the crown of my head. May I behold the entrance to the ocean of liberation stories. Though there are no faults in this composition made through the holy words and my devoted mind, whatever mistakes occurred due to childish understanding, may the wise ones who see reality be forbearing. Through the daylight of merit accumulated from composing this, having completely dispelled the darkness of evil friends for beings who dwell in the cave of wrong views, may they enter the authentic path without obstruction. This brief account of the liberation story of the holy venerable guru was written by Sonam Lhundrup Legpa'i Jungnay Gyaltshan Palzang, who received a small amount of nectar from the speech of the Venerable Thukyi Dorje, thinking it would serve as a path for his own devotion and also be a cause of faith for others of equal fortune. Making naturalness itself the supreme ornament, this was written at the temple of glorious Drakkar Thegchen Ling on the third day of the second month of the Dog year. Since Palden Dorje's biography composed by Menyag Dragdor was not found, it was later appended below. @#/ The Liberation Story of the Dharma King, the Precious Omniscient Sonam Senge by Sangye Rinchen. I respectfully prostrate and take refuge at the immaculate lotus feet of the venerable guru endowed with great compassion.

From the two perfect accumulations of merit and wisdom,
Having taken hold of the treasury of marvelous qualities well-arisen,
To the omniscient guru who propagated Śākyasiṃha's teachings,
I respectfully bow down.

Having respectfully drawn just a drop
From the unfrozen ocean of his liberation story,
To increase the merit of limitless disciples,
Listen with one-pointed mind to what will be written.

Here, regarding our supreme guide, the Dharma King, the Precious Omniscient Gobo Rabjampa Sonam Senge, as he is universally known - though in definitive meaning he had already achieved the result by completing the two accumulations countless eons ago, when speaking briefly of his liberation story of taking birth for the sake of disciples in this realm:

In the region of Zambuling in the land of Tibet, the Land of Snows, in the region of Do Kham Bom, he was born in the Female Earth Bird year to father Zhang Kyab and mother Gyalwa Men. He was given the name Minyag Pal. This holy being transcended childish behavior. Due to his awakening to the dharma lineage, when he was five or six years old, he learned reading and writing just by being shown the signs. Since all his conduct of the three doors was in accordance with the tradition, everyone unanimously proclaimed that a holy being would come. 

When he reached eight years of age, he took ordination from Khenpo Sonam Ozer and Lopön Kunga Bum, and was given the name Sonam Senge. He also received the basic trainings of the novice vows from both the preceptor and teacher. Then he went to meet Gobo Rabjampa Sherab Palwa.

[He] said "Stay here for a while to study," and [Sonam Senge] memorized many texts including the Four Great Treatises and the root and entering texts of Madhyamaka. [The master] gave the oral transmission of the Rong Commentary. Being very pleased that [Sonam Senge] had retained it in his mind, [the master] said "Someone like myself has appeared" and bestowed upon him the title "Gobo Rabjampa. "

Furthermore, he received many empowerments, permissions, bodhicitta [ceremonies] and so forth. On one occasion, while doing the Mañjuśrī retreat, in a dream a sword appeared in his hand. When he drew the sword from its sheath and brandished it in the sky, it appeared to pervade all of Ü, Tsang and Kham. When he asked Sherab Palwa about this, [the master] said it was a sign that inconceivable enlightened activity would arise. Additionally, from Kachu Jinzangpa he received various dharma teachings, from Lama Gyaltsen Özer he received the Hevajra empowerment, and from Rabdo Chöje Rinlopa he received several cycles of teachings including the permission of the Eighty Mahāsiddhas. Then when he reached twenty years of age, Gobo Rabjampa Sherab Palwa said "Now you must go to Ü-Tsang" and gave him provisions and supplies. Along with a letter of introduction and many hundreds of offerings for Rongton Omniscient One, he departed with a hundred monks who praised and honored him. He arrived at Paldendarlag in the Dragon year. Upon meeting Rongton Chöje, [the master] was very pleased. When giving the permission of Lord Acala, [Rongton] said "Acala dissolved into the load carried by a hundred Khampas. " He also made a prophecy that [Sonam Senge] would uphold Acala's lineage.

During the summer teachings, [Rongton] said he gave all the teachings on Acala. Then, from Lingshe Sherab Palden, he received the permission for the Names of Mañjuśrī and the uncommon recitation method of Dharmarāja. Then, thinking in his mind that he should complete his studies by relying on a learned friend who could teach the vast textual traditions - since Rongton Chöje was no longer present - while wondering who would be best, he recalled that Rongton Chöje had previously said that "our monk Jamchen Rabjampa established teachings like thunder at Kharag Bondrug in the Dragon year" and based on that instruction, in the Snake year. When he was twenty-one years old, he went to Drepung Kyedmotsal to meet the Lord of the Complete Teachings, the Omniscient Dharma King Sangye Pel. He received teachings on:
1. The Five Dharmas of Maitreya with their respective commentaries
2. Pramāṇa texts:
   2. 1 Sūtra
   2. 2 Pramāṇavārttika
   2. 3 Pramāṇaviniścaya
   2. 4 Nyāyabindu with their respective commentaries
3. Vinaya texts:
   3. 1 Prātimokṣasūtra
   3. 2 Mūlasūtra
   3. 3 Extensive Commentary
   3. 4 Vinayasutramalā and others
4. Abhidharma texts:
   4. 1 Abhidharmasamuccaya

   5. 4 Collections of Praises and many others
6. Additional texts:
   6. 1 Caryāvatāra
   6. 2 The three excellent ones: Jam, Du and Zang, and many other explanatory permissions

He not only received these teachings in name only but:
1. Through learning, he took them into his mind
2. Through contemplation, he retained them without forgetting
3. Through meditation, he properly focused his mind on them.

Through his mastery of learning and contemplation, the entire assembly was amazed and proclaimed, "This is truly a Rabjampa (master of vast knowledge)." The Omniscient Dharma King repeatedly offered him three forms of praise, honor, and acclaim, calling him "the great-headed Khampa," and accepted him with great joy. He requested the great patron of the dharma, Drungchen Norzangpa, saying "This student of mine who has come, this wise Khampa, is someone who I hope will benefit the teachings, so please extend support and kindness to him." The official agreed and instructed the chief supervisor of the five goats, Ralö Dorje, saying "Provide consistent support with robes and provisions for Gobo Rabjampa." He properly fulfilled this service, and later continued to regularly offer robes and other necessities.

At age twenty-five, he requested several cycles of teachings including Hayagrīva Chakralana from Chöje Gewa Gyaltshenpa. Then in that same autumn, with intense dedication to studying the three tantras and their instructions, and with intense devotional faith in the Lord Vajradhara and his spiritual sons that moved his mind-stream, he went to glorious Ewam Chöden. In the presence of the great Vajradhara, he first received the commentary traditions of Hevajra and the Samputa empowerments of Vajradhātu. When asked to blow the conch shell of the empowerment three times, the sound came out very loud. It was said this accorded with his fame and that he would benefit the teachings.

After that, in the presence of the precious lord, he received many profound and vast empowerments, blessings, authorizations, tantras, explanations of Indian texts, and various transmissions, including two cycles of the precious Lamdre teachings. Then at age twenty-six, in the male wood-dog year, under Lord Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo as preceptor, with the great bodhisattva Konchok Gyaltshen and Khenchen Khacharwa as secret masters, he received the completely pure bhikshu ordination vows in the midst of the supplementary sangha. He maintained these without incurring even the slightest infractions. Then from the lord great bodhisattva, he received five cycles of Lamdre instructions. During these occasions, he received everything listed in the catalog of texts, including: the bodhicitta rituals from both lineages, causal path empowerments, Nairātmyā empowerments, blessings, instructions, and textual explanations. He also received the Shungdön Marma, Marma, and Ponagma explanatory texts, along with all the profound blessings, instructions and transmissions according to the contents of Vajradhara's red volume catalog containing the Four Profound Dharmas that Never Stray from the Iron Mountain directly granted to Lord Sachen by the Mahāsiddha. Additionally, he received all the miscellaneous guru biographies, the detailed general guru biography "Wondrous Vision Subtle Vajra" along with Barton's notes, and all instructions of the path and fruition up to and including the practice authorization.

From Gayadhara's lineage, he received the permission of the single-deity Mahākāla. From Chöje Gungru Sherab Zangpo, he received the Ocean of Ḍākinīs empowerment, the permission of Gaṇapati, and explanations of the Three Vows (Domsum Rabye) and others. These enumerations are just a rough outline - one should know that the teachings he received that are not included here are inconceivable in number. Having completed his studies, the way he engaged in practice was as follows:
1. At Kyedmotsal in Drakpul, he completed the foundational approach of Hevajra
2. At the hermitage of Samten Phuk, he stayed for one year performing:
   2. 1 The approach practice of Yamāntaka and other yidams
   2. 2 Complete investigation and realization of the three Hevajra tantras along with their instructions
3. At Jamchen Serkading:
   3. 1 Performed the approach practice of Cakrasaṃvara
   3. 2 Practiced Lama Rinchung until receiving signs

During intervals between teaching and studying, he repeatedly performed:
1. The approach practice of Yamāntaka with fire offerings
2. The approach practice of Hevajra with restoration fire offerings
3. The practice of Lama Rinchung
4. The approach practice of Mahākāla and others

In particular, he continuously practiced the four sessions or three or two sessions of visualization and mantra recitation of many yidams, especially the main practices of the glorious Sakyapa:
1. The Four Inseparables (Chakme Zhi)
2. Cakrasaṃvara Ghaṇṭapāda
3. Five-deity Yamāntaka
4. Mahākāla's protection circle and others

He also applied great diligence to the torma rituals and fulfillment offerings of the yidams and dharma protectors.

From these practices, the way he received blessings from the guru and yidams, received prophecies, and accomplished the activities of ḍākinīs and dharma protectors was as follows:

1. Gobo Rabjampa Sherab Palwa prophesied that someone of equal scholarly ability to himself would come

2. When performing the approach practice of Mañjuśrī, he had a vision of a sword brandished in the sky pervading the three regions of Ü, Tsang, and Kham, which was a sign of being accepted by Mañjuśrī

3. When Rongton Chenpo (the Omniscient One) gave him the permission of Acala, he said "Acala from Kham has dissolved into this one"

4. He was blessed by Lord Acala himself in the tantra

5. When traveling on Rongchung's narrow path carrying a text, he fell into the Tsangpo River when the path broke. Caught in the water's current, he visualized Sakya Paṇḍita at his crown and remained there reciting the Twenty-four Dharmarāja verses until travelers saw him and safely pulled him out - this shows he definitely received Sakya Paṇḍita's blessings

6. Lord Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo prophesied that he would become greatly renowned during an empowerment authorization

7. The night after receiving Kurukullā authorization from the Lord, in his dream a woman wearing maroon brocade offered him a handful of fresh fruit and told him to eat it, and

7. The night after receiving Kurukullā authorization from the Lord, in his dream a woman wearing maroon brocade offered him a red drum and told him to play it, indicating he was blessed by the ḍākinī lineage. 8. While staying in Drayul, when he had a severe illness, in the dream of the great mantra holder Rinchen Namgyal, it appeared to be an obstacle from a king. When requested to perform spiritual practice focusing on this, he meditated for about half a month on exchanging and taking (tonglen) of bodhicitta and the view of the inseparability of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. In a dream, the Lord Mahāsattva gave him the complete Hevajra vase empowerment and said his bodily impurities were purified. Then he awoke and was freed from the illness. 9. At Lingkha Dewachen, the evening before Lord Mahāsattva was to teach the root text commentary the next day, when the Lord himself experienced unbearable physical pain, thinking the Lord Mahāsattva would know, he had a dream where Lord Mahāsattva came and touched his body with his saliva. When he awoke, the pain disappeared like clouds dispersing. 10. One night in a dream, when he saw many monks building a teaching throne on top of a lion and asked whose it was, they said it was the throne for the Lord Muchen's teaching of the Purification Tantra. The guru also helped, and after Muchen ascended the throne and taught the Purification Tantra with many attendants, he listened well and retained about one verse in his mind, which he later wrote exactly as it was in the Kunrik debate response. 11. When he requested Lord Mahāsattva's assessment about going to Kham, he was told: "No assessment needed. Going to Kham will bring some wealth but not long life, and benefit to beings will be small. Staying in Ü-Tsang will bring somewhat longer life and vast benefit to beings. ".

While preparing to establish teaching and learning activities, he requested blessings and instructions, and [the master] placed his feet on his crown. He gave authentic blessings of the guru lineage and instructions of the dharma protectors. He offered one hundred and one precious nectar pills, one hundred more, and many other offerings. Through this, Lord Mahāsattva Konchok Gyaltsen accepted him as his disciple, blessed him, and empowered him as a master of the doctrine.

When Lord Dharma Kunga Wangchuk traveled to Mangri, he escorted him from Tanak Ridge to the riverside. [The master] gave him many nectar pills of Drogon Phagpa and said "Look toward that monastery over there," thus creating an auspicious connection for his future ascension to the throne. During a causal empowerment, in a dream someone said "You are creating auspicious connections for vast benefit to others" and poured what was said to be Jetsun Drakpa's vase water on his body, whereupon he had a vision of transforming into the form of Amitāyus. These and other direct and symbolic blessings and prophecies from gurus and yidams were beyond imagination.

Regarding how the dharma protectors accomplished activities: One night while staying at Tanak Serling, when the discipline master came to make a request, he arrived early. A black person wearing a conch earring, who seemed to be Putra, actually appeared and was about to make some commotion, but [the master] said "Now go away."

When he said "Now go away," [the master] departed. When performing a torma ritual and fulfillment offering, the banner of the Four-Faced Mahākāla's torma bowed its head toward the master's direction. During his stay at Thubten, one night in a dream, there were two Mon children who seemed to be in a cave at Kyelas Rock. They appeared to be among his attendants. He said, "These seem to be emanations of Four-Faced Mahākāla in brahmin form. " The two Mon children bowed their heads and smiled. Then they asked, "Since you are the Jñānanātha (Wisdom Protector) with unobstructed clairvoyance, would you prefer to do single-pointed practice at the end of life or to teach?" They repeatedly said "practice, practice," nodded their heads, and smiled - thus he dreamed. When composing the General Meaning of Valid Cognition [Pramāṇa],

In a dream, he and Lama Lorin were chanting the "Non-conceptual Praise" with melody. From the upper valley appeared many musical sounds, arrays of light, and numerous armies. When asked what they were, they said these were the armies of glorious Four-Faced Mahākāla. Looking at them, they were about three stories tall from the knees down. The attendants' armor gleamed brilliantly, and their boot decorations jingled. They said "We will be the masters of your treatise. " In the dream of the Omniscient Namsod Chenpo, the Protective Tent [Gur Gon] of Sakya took one step at Phurmo Chodzong and set up camp at Drakbawa. When he wondered about its meaning, he said it indicated that when this master later established a monastic college at Taknak Serling, the Sakya teachings would flourish.

From time to time, when minor obstacles arose, by performing protector torma rituals and fulfillment offerings for just a few days, it was directly evident that he was freed from obstacles.

As for how he carried out enlightened activities for the benefit of others: When this master reached thirty-two years of age, in the Dragon year, at the urging of his elder brother Yeshe Gyaltsen, he went to Sakya Kyedmotshal in Kham in accordance with the dharma tradition. When he made the request to the Omniscient Dharma King, permission was not granted. When he made repeated earnest requests, he was told "Since my superior is the Mahāsattva, go and request from him." When Yeshe Gyaltsen went and made the request to the Mahāsattva, the response came that staying in Ü-Tsang would bring greater benefit to beings. From then on, he decided not to go to Kham.

While staying at Kyedmotshal and thoroughly teaching the sūtra traditions, the Omniscient Sangye Phel said: "I am going to Mus to request the remaining teachings from the Mahāsattva. During that time, have Gobo Rabjampa act as my substitute and teach. The monks should also make offerings to him."

After giving detailed instructions to those who needed guidance, he departed for Mus. The master himself, following the established tradition, thoroughly satisfied disciples through countless teachings of the piṭakas including Pramāṇa and Vinaya-Abhidharma, as well as countless vajrayāna teachings such as empowerment into the five-deity maṇḍala of Bhagavān Raktayamāri.

Then, shortly after Omniscient Sangye Phel arrived from Mus to Kyedmotshal, when the master was thirty-seven in the Bird year, he went to Mus to meet the great Mahāsattva. That year, Jamchen Chöje Sönam Chökyi Kunga Tashi also came to Mus. The two teacher and student received many profound and vast teachings including the Path and Its Fruit from the great Mahāsattva. The master himself also taught countless dharma topics including the Sakya Kabum to many monks of the full assembly.

During those occasions, there were repeated discussions about establishing a teaching program with Jamchen Chöje. The evening before they decided to seek counsel from the great Mahāsattva the next day, in Jamchen Chöje's dream, he saw a great dharma throne being constructed. When he asked whose it was, he was told it belonged to Lord Drakpa Gyaltsen. The next day when the three - teacher and students - met, Jamchen Chöje related his dream and requested permission to establish the teaching program. The noble great Mahāsattva was pleased and said it was an excellent connection. They decided to establish the teaching program. Jamchen Chöje departed for the east.

For about two months, the great Mahāsattva did retreat at Samten Phuk. Near the end of the retreat, this master requested and received the Jigje empowerment in the Sa tradition, along with twenty-one teacher-student disciples led by the master himself and the two sibling lords of accomplishment, Könchok Lodrö. 

Subsequently, in the autumn of the Dog year, when the great Mahāsattva was invited to Ngamring Chöde, he gave the Path and Its Fruit and other teachings to an assembly of about eight hundred.

In addition to the great turning of the wheel of dharma, the master himself went after the great bodhisattva. Led by the teachers of Ngamring Chöde, he thoroughly taught the explanation of the Three Tantras to many monks from Kham and Tsang. Subsequently, in the summer of the Dog year, based on discussions about establishing a teaching program, the master himself went to meet Jamchen Chöje. He did retreat for one or two months at Serka Ding. In autumn, Jamchen Chöje and his disciples went to Samdrub Tse to establish the teaching program. On the way to Serling, they met a person carrying a gong [gaṇḍī] for sale. Saying this was a very auspicious connection, they bought and carried the gong up. Then they arrived at Serling, and in the first month of the Male Fire Dog year, they established the monastery with about forty students, thus planting the root for the flourishing of the teachings.

During all this, Jamchen Chöje provided material support including one thousand sheep and other resources. Nangso Tsenchen Döndrup Dorje established regular provisions for the food of the resident teacher and students, and also instituted summer and winter allowances for the general assembly. Pöndrung Yungpa Tsewang Tashi also provided regular allowances from Dokhar. Regarding how the teacher and students conducted their studies, in the rules composed by the master himself, it states: "Our system of explanation and study is that of Lord Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo."

Having an exceptional fondness for teaching and studying the piṭakas, and based on the direct command from the great Mahāsattva of Mus stating "Establish a foundation for teaching and studying sūtra and tantra," with patronage from Lord Sönam Chökyi Kunga Tashi Gyaltsen Palzang, they established the new monastery of Tanak Serling on the fifteenth day of the month of Victory Star in the Male Fire Dog year. This was done:
1. For the general flourishing of the Buddha's teachings
2. To prevent the essential points of the excellent philosophical system from declining
3. For oneself to diligently familiarize with the words and meaning of the Buddha's teachings.

There were no other principal motivations that were either non-virtuous or based on prophecies. The reason for this is also evident from how the harmonious teaching and study programs progressively increased up until eight years prior. Now, if we were to briefly describe the conduct of those residing here from then until the continuation of this teaching program:

Generally, all practices regarding:
1. Lineage of blessings
2. Ultimate view
3. Conventional philosophical tenets
4. Methods of commenting on scripture
5. Traditions of explanation and practice

must follow the tradition of the Lords of the Snow Land's teachings - the venerable Sakyapa fathers and sons. In particular, regarding the methods of practicing the teachings through diligent study and their practical applications, [we follow] the two masters of Yadrong.

The methods of teaching the piṭaka texts as established by the master of speech Sangye Phel, the eldest son of the lord of wisdom Drakpa Zangpo, who was my teacher, along with their practical applications, should be followed. In accordance with this instruction and consistent with the nine yogic practices, the master himself maintained the profound practice of the generation and completion stages as transmitted from the previous gurus. From this state, regarding the various methods of teaching the piṭaka texts, he taught decisively through commentaries, general meanings, and difficult point explanations on:

4. Two Guhyasamāja traditions

He also bestowed explanations and transmissions of Indian and Tibetan texts that support these tantras, instructions, and empowerments.

For authorization ceremonies, he granted countless ones including:
1. Hundred Sādhanas
2. Ocean
3. Vijayajambha
4. Arapacana
5. Iron-Sword Hayagrīva
6. Ucchusma
7. Element-Taming

11. Mahākaruṇika lineage transmission

Furthermore, he taught:

2. Freedom from four attachments
3. Chöd instructions
4. Mind Training in Seven Points instructions

For transmissions, he gave countless teachings including:
1. Five Supreme Ones
2. Works of the two Lords - father and son
3. His own collected works

In this way, when he was causing the Buddha's teachings to shine like the sun at dawn, the patron of the dharma, the great Tsang Döndrub Dorje, offered the monastery of Thubten Nampar Gyalwa at Pönlön Rinchen Tse. When he reached the age of forty-five in the Female Water Snake year, the master and disciples arrived there. They properly managed the maintenance of the monastery's facilities including the lama's residence, assembly hall, and both common and private quarters.

Having settled there, he caused the teachings of sutra and tantra to flourish even more than before among the hundreds of gathered monks. During this period, he occasionally went up to Ewam Chöden to receive instructions and oral transmissions from Master Kunga Wangchuk.

He also made several visits to give profound instructions to the resident monks there, particularly establishing the seat of Master Palden Dorje. Before ascending to the throne himself, he satisfied disciples with extensive dharma teachings including the Path and Fruit teachings for two winter sessions.

He also made several visits to meet the Omniscient Dharma King at Drayul Gawa Dong and other places. Particularly, in the Mouse year, three years after establishing the monastic college, he went to Glelong Chöde with about twenty disciples to meet the great bodhisattva Venerable Könchok Gyaltsen. There he received some profound instructions on the Hevajra empowerment and instructions. After receiving advice to spread both sutra and tantra teachings, the master and disciples returned.

He also gave teachings while visiting other places with his disciples: Gawa Tshal, Do Khar, the great seat of glorious Sakya, Trophu, Bodong, and Ja. He went to Chum Dechen to give one round of Path and Fruit teachings accompanied by many disciples aspiring to the secret mantra teachings.

After he taught two rounds of the Path and Fruit teachings at Ewam, the assembly of disciples of the Ngor lineage's masters earnestly requested him to become the throne-holder. Considering this would fulfill the intentions of the Lord Guru and his spiritual sons, he ascended to the throne on the fifth day of the first month of the Hare year. During the four years of Hare, Dragon, Snake, and Horse, through numerous dharma methods including the Three Tantras and their instructions, he led countless disciples to maturity and liberation.

During these periods, at Thubten monastery, three masters took responsibility for teaching the students: Master Rinpoche Sönam Gyatso, Dharma Lord Thukje Palzang, and Dharma Lord Wangchuk Drubpa. Based on their teaching activities, the flourishing of the doctrine continued undiminished from before.

Then, on the special occasion of the twenty-fifth day of the Saga month in the Horse year, as prophesied by Vajradhara and his spiritual sons, and having gained confidence in his two heart disciples who had mastered the stages, he enthroned the great master Dharma Lord Rinpoche Könchok Phel, who had mastery over the ocean of secret mantra including the Three Tantras and their instructions, at the seat of Ewam Chöden. After giving him offerings and detailed instructions about undertaking extensive activities for the doctrine, he returned to Thubten Namgyal with great joy and, as before, taught inconceivable dharma teachings of sutra and tantra.

How he spread the teachings through debate: At Drayul Kyemö Tshal, when Tsethang Rabjampa Sang Lhünpa made assertions with confidence, this master defeated him through the power of reasoning. Having engaged in the three spheres of equal force, even the Omniscient Dharma King bestowed three forms of praise: admiration, honor, and acclaim. All the scripture-holders of the Vagīśvara tradition who were present there, without the master making logical arguments, concluded that such reasoning naturally arose and determined that wisdom born from meditation had arisen. As illustrated by this, extensive knowledge can be understood through his refutations of debates on the three tantras - Hevajra, Guhyasamāja, and Sarvavid - as well as through his responses to questions on the Three Vows and other topics. How he spread the teachings through composition:
1. Praises to Vajradhara and his spiritual sons
2. Biography of the Great Being with commentary
3. Supplication to Lama Rinchen Jung
4. Praise to Gobo Rabjampa Sherab Palwa
5. Praises to:
   5. 1 Omniscient Sangye Phel
   5. 2 Dagchen Lodrö Wangchuk
   5. 3 Throphu's Great Maitreya
6. Praises to:
   6. 1 White Vajravārāhī
   6. 2 Eight Deities of Gur
7. Guru puja of Hevajra
8. Supplication to the gurus of Paramāṇa lineage

During these and other occasions, through the power of his meditation and realization, he had inconceivable visions of gurus, yidam deities, buddhas, bodhisattvas, ḍākinīs and dharma protectors in direct and symbolic forms. His clairvoyant predictions also seemed to come true exactly as foretold.

Having thus illuminated the Buddha's teachings extensively through the three activities of the learned, regarding the fruition of his enlightened activities and how he established holders of the teachings: When he ascended to the Sakya throne, the emanation of Mañjuśrī, the great master Sönam Gyaltsen and his siblings...

When he ascended to the E-waṃ Chöden throne, led by the supreme guide, the precious Dharma Lord Könchok Pelwa, who possessed abundant wisdom, love, and power, there were inconceivable direct disciples including: abbots of monasteries from Upper Ngari, Lower Dokham, and Central Ü-Tsang regions; monastery lamas; teachers of monks; and his own personal disciples. Their direct disciples, and their disciples' disciples and so forth, upheld his words like the Buddha's words, maintaining the Buddha's teachings like a flowing river.

Regarding his first two visits to teach Dharma at Sakya: He first arrived at Sakya in the end of the Dog year when he was fifty years old. He stayed until the third month of the Pig year. During that time, he bestowed many empowerments to the spiritual friends of Sakya including the Hevajra Ocean-Born system, taught many tantric explanatory traditions including General Presentation of Tantra Classes and Root Tantra Hevajra in Two Sections, and gave inconceivable teachings on the Tripitaka including Three Vows Distinguished to the monastic assembly. He gave innumerable Dharma teachings to crowds of people on topics like Freedom from the Four Attachments. He offered countless butter lamps and ceremonial scarves before sacred objects, made extensive offerings in the protector temples, and made aspirational prayers for the flourishing of Buddha's teachings and the happiness of all beings. He also performed numerous tea offerings to the monastic assembly.

He showed great respect to his lama-disciples through offerings from patrons including monastic leaders, teachers, monks, and high officials. After the lama-disciples dedicated the teachings, they visited sacred sites including: Muglung, the place of the great translator Drogmi of Mangkhar; the meditation cave of Gayadhara at Lhatse; and Saktang Ding of Zhingönpa. Having completed prayers and aspirations according to the Buddha's intent, they proceeded to Thubten Namgyal. Later, when he was sixty years old, in the Monkey year he went back to Sakya. Before that year ended, while staying at his seat, he made offerings before the Three Jewels, gave tea offerings to the monastic assembly along with generous gold offerings, and bestowed extensive Dharma teachings appropriate to each assembly of monastics and laypeople. When returning from teaching in the first month of the Bird year, while staying for some days teaching at Ngönmo Dzong, due to an illness related to his shadow-form, considering his activities in this realm were temporarily complete, at age sixty-one, on the twenty-first day of the first month, he dissolved his form body into the dharmadhātu. Regarding earlier events he said: "At age twenty-five I arrived at Ngor and received many empowerments and transmissions including Commentary Tradition from Lord Vajradhara. At thirty-seven, at Mü, I received many teachings from the great Mahāsattva including Path and Fruit and causal empowerments. At forty-nine, with specific purpose, I went to request causal empowerments from Dharma Lord Kunga Wangchuk. ".

From the time he turned sixty-one, he remained in accordance with his prophecy about the future when he had said, "Now it would be good if I could do a retreat in the meditation cave. Otherwise, who knows what might happen?" After that, his sacred remains were invited to Thubten. Four vajra masters, including Dharma Lord Tsultrim Zangpo and the incarnation of Mahāsattva Zhönnu Gyalchok, continuously performed ritual offerings. To fulfill the wishes of the monastic assembly, led primarily by the labrang and supported by monks and patrons according to their individual means, they offered continuous tea ceremonies for two months and performed prayers. That summer, the incomparable precious Dharma Lord Könchok Pelwa came to Thubten Namgyal and gave instructions regarding the construction of the temple's inner sacred objects and bestowed Dharma teachings to the monks.

On the twenty-first day of the eighth lunar month, they performed the cremation ceremony with fire offerings. From the time of his peaceful passing until before the remains were consumed, rainbow lights appeared continuously in the sky along with showers of flowers. When the reliquary chamber was opened on the full moon day, his head appeared intact, and countless relics emerged from his bones and ashes. The skull was enshrined in the heart center of the inner sacred objects. One portion of the bone relics was made into tsatsas and enshrined within the statue and inner sacred objects. Another portion was crafted into a statue of Mañjuśrī, adorned with gold, and distributed in various directions as blessing supports.

In the ninth lunar month, on an ascending date, with Chöje Ngorpa as the main officiant, together with his disciples and officials, they performed consecration ceremonies according to the Tantra classes for the inner sacred objects and statue relics. These remain radiating with the light of blessings.

As a supplement to the biographies of the Path and Fruit lineage masters, this was composed by the vajra-holding bhikṣu Sangye Rinchen, who for a long time touched his crown to the lotus feet of the lord himself, on the twenty-fourth day of the last month of the Male Water Monkey year at Lingkha Dewachen. May this cause the blessings of the guru to enter the mindstreams of all beings!

In brief, you are the embodiment of Śākyasiṃha who perfected merit and wisdom. I pray to you single-pointedly - please grant your blessings right now!

Having abandoned the two obscurations and perfected the two accumulations, with both self and others' purposes perfectly accomplished

Omniscient Sönam Senge, you who abide in the unchanging, undefiled state of great bliss. The six classes of beings who have not been benefited remain in the terrifying three realms of samsara, tormented by the three unbearable sufferings - may the omniscient guru look upon them with compassion!

Particularly those foolish, sinful ones without protection or refuge, separated from you, their divine protector - those who delight in non-Dharma yet possess supreme qualities - look upon them swiftly with compassion, O Guru!

Having abandoned meaningless activities of this life, without interest in achieving samsaric prosperity, having generated bodhicitta that values others over self - grant me realization of the inexpressible view!

Particularly, having abandoned the two extremes with a humble mind, without ego-clinging to place and retinue, wandering without preference in mountain hermitages - grant me contentment with whatever comes!

In those solitary places, from you, the holy one, the instructions on the two stages and so forth - grant me the ability to practice these solely for beings' benefit, free from self-interest!

For one practicing single-pointedly in this way, may all adverse conditions and obstacles be pacified right now, and may favorable conditions be effortlessly and spontaneously granted!

Then grant me experiential realization of the inseparable union of: whatever appears as appearance-emptiness deities, whatever sounds as sound-emptiness mantra melodies, whatever arises as mind's display of bliss-emptiness!

Having achieved stability myself, like you holy one, without concern for body and life, grant me the ability to continuously teach the profound Dharma to beings!

Until enlightenment is attained, may you holy one care for me, and maintaining the continuous flow of your holy Dharma teachings, grant me swift attainment of complete buddhahood!

Having bestowed supreme and common siddhis to one who makes this praise just once with faith, devotion and joy, may the glorious guru grant his blessings!

By the virtue of this praise and supplication, may I and all beings equal to space, having abandoned the two obscurations and perfected the two accumulations, swiftly attain buddhahood!

This praise song of liberation called "The Wish-fulfilling Cow of Blessings that Generates Faith" about the life story of the one renowned like the sun and moon, named Goram Tenpa'i Nyima Kunkhyen Sönam Senge - the guru of beings of the three realms, the great Vajradhara of the age of conflict, the new Mañjuśrī of the degenerate age - was composed having abandoned bias, exaggeration, denigration and so forth

Having relied upon the dust of that holy guru's feet and hearing from his speech with certainty and conviction for seventeen years without separation, and based on what was directly heard from reliable holy friends endowed with perfect faith and wisdom like the learned young scribe Aho and others, in order to receive the guru's blessings in my own mindstream, I, the least among that holy guru's disciples, the hermit monk named Kunga Chokden, wrote this in the Male Water-Rat year. On the twenty-first day of the month of Mrigaśīrṣa [smin drug], the day of offering, motivated by faith and with great urgency, I quickly wrote this in the small bamboo hut at the isolated hermitage of Cholung Mountain. Though these are just the rough outlines of the common biography known to most disciples, it should be known that for fortunate disciples there exist inconceivable biographical accounts not included here. Although others describe inconceivable biographical accounts, fearing there might be exaggeration and denigration, I did not write them here due to lack of certainty. What is presented here is completely free from bias, exaggeration and denigration, as I am greatly fearful of the faults. As for what those faults are, Mañjuśrī Sakya Paṇḍita said: "If one falls into partiality, even praise becomes a cause for blame. " Thus it is taught that if one falls into bias and exaggeration/denigration, even intended praise of the guru becomes blame. And if one criticizes even a single hair of a guru from whom one has received the complete four empowerments, the Buddha taught in many tantras that it is equivalent to criticizing infinite buddhas of the ten directions.

Therefore, contemplating what faults would arise - one should understand. Similarly, for one who has received the complete four empowerments, faithfully serving the guru and praising without exaggeration or denigration brings inconceivable benefits. As stated in the Atikodha Tantra: "Merit from applying a single drop of oil to a pore of a guru's body hair exceeds even a hundredth of the merit from making offerings and serving Vajradhara for a hundred kalpas." And from the Yoginī Caryā: "One skilled in words of praise to the guru receives blessings and attains renown." Therefore, those wise ones who remain impartial should only take as reasons for faith those biographical contents that are trustworthy and worthy of faith. I request your great patience regarding my ignorant verses and compositions, as I am but a foolish person.

The Biography of the Omniscient Sönam Senge: A Stream of Faith

Homage and refuge in the stainless lotus feet of the holy guru, the omniscient Dharma king. Please accept me with your great compassion! Bowing to the feet of the omniscient guru - sole cause of all perfect merit, sovereign of Śākyasiṃha's teachings - I shall relate a fraction of his deeds.

In this biographical account of the supreme guide of all beings including gods, the Omniscient Master Gorampa Tenpa Nyima Sönam Senge, who is inseparable in ultimate truth from the Victorious Lord Vajradhara himself, though no one can fully describe his liberation story exactly as it was, as confirmed through scripture, reasoning, oral instructions, and the words of previous gurus. However, as it is said: "Like the sun of the Buddha descending upon the mountain of disciples according to their capacity."

For the benefit of disciples, he manifested as a great spiritual friend in human form in the Land of Snows to spread virtuous deeds. Based on the words of authentic holy beings, I will relate a fraction of this.

First, regarding the liberation story of his birth lineage: In general, it is the nature of things that holy beings demonstrate taking birth after first considering in which place and as whom they should take birth to benefit beings. Thus, it is heard that this holy lord was born in the region of Domla Teng Bomlung in Dokham, to father Rutsa Zhangkyab and mother Gyalwa Men. When he entered his mother's womb, there were auspicious signs. He was born in the Female Earth Bird year accompanied by many wonderful signs and was given the name Nyak Pal. This holy being had clear faculties and was pleasant to behold. All expressions of his three doors transcended ordinary behavior, and he awakened to the dharmic disposition.

From a young age, all expressions of his three doors transcended ordinary behavior and he awakened to the dharmic disposition. It is said that by age six or seven, he could understand merely by being shown writing and reading.

Among his five siblings, this lord was the second eldest. The eldest became an artist of religious icons, and the youngest, Lekpa Gyaltsen, became a monk. Lekpa Gyaltsen traveled to Ü-Tsang, studied at the feet of this lord, and became rich in profound and vast teachings. He then returned to Dokham where he extensively benefited the doctrine and beings.

Regarding his entrance into the doctrine: When this holy being was six or seven years old, while reading "Bhadracarya" (The Aspiration for Excellent Conduct), upon merely seeing the words "When I am at the time of death...", he thoroughly understood the nature of impermanence of composite phenomena. Genuine bodhicitta arose in his mind and he wept profusely. Indeed, it is the nature of things that signs of bodhicitta manifest from the very beginning whenever holy beings take birth.

It is also heard that at that time, the meaning of the scriptures became clear to him like reflections appearing in a mirror. Then, seeing all of samsara as suffering by nature, intense renunciation arose in him. He requested his parents' permission to become ordained, which they granted. At age eight, he received the upasaka vows from the holy master of discipline Kunga Bum and established himself in the root of the doctrine, the Pratimoksha. At age ten, before the preceptor Sönam Özer...

From the preceptor Kunga Bum, he received the śrāmaṇera vows and was given the name Sönam Senge. Then he began his studies. He heard the basic precepts of śrāmaṇera training from both the preceptor and master. In his studies of calculation summaries and scripture memorization, his supreme intelligence was so vast that it amazed everyone's minds, being beyond ordinary comprehension. Everyone proclaimed that this young monk would certainly become a great scholar [rab 'byams smra ba], and thus the title "Rabjam" naturally stuck to him from that time. His diligence was also extraordinary. When he met with Gobo Rabjampa Sherab Palwa, who told him to stay and study, he mastered approximately fourteen major textual traditions including: the thirteen major scriptural texts such as Madhyamaka Mūla and Avatāra, the Five Dharmas of Maitreya, Pramāṇaviniścaya, Pramāṇavārttika, and others, as well as the Trisamvaraprabheda. He also thoroughly learned up to the three knowledges of the Yak Commentary [g. yag Tika] Precious Garland, the complete Rong Commentary [rong Tika], and the contradictory and solar wheels of the summary notes. Having studied and examined many aspects of dharma including empowerments and bodhicitta generation, that holy teacher was pleased and said "Someone like me will emerge," and bestowed upon him the name "Gobo Rabjampa. " At one point during this time, while doing the sādhana of Mañjuśrī, he dreamed that a sword with its scabbard appeared in his hand. When he drew it from the scabbard and brandished it in the sky, a sign appeared that it covered the three regions of Ü, Tsang and Kham.

This was truly a sign of being blessed by the special deity, as explained by holy beings that such definite signs are described in many tantras like the Mañjuśrī Root Tantra. When Gobo Rabjampa Sherab Palwa analyzed the dream, he prophesied, "You will accomplish inconceivable enlightened activities at a monastery facing south or east." This prophecy manifested exactly as foretold. Furthermore, he received various profound and vast teachings from Kachu Jinzang. At age thirteen, he received the Hevajra empowerment in the oral instruction tradition from Lama Gyaltsen Özer, and it is said he received several teaching cycles including the authorization of the Eighty Mahāsiddhas from Chöje Rinlo.

Then regarding his journey to seek the holy dharma in Ü-Tsang: At age nineteen, a strong wish arose to go to Ü-Tsang for studies. As he prepared provisions and travel companions, he thought: "Having abandoned this ocean of poison of afflictions that is my homeland, may I swiftly journey to the hundred-petaled lotus garden of the wondrous dharma centers of the central regions, the abode where flocks of learned and disciplined ones play."

Accordingly, Gobo Rabjampa Sherab Palwa also said he must go to Ü-Tsang and provided gifts for the journey.

When going to present a petition letter to the Omniscient Rongton, among hundreds of monks bringing hundreds of petitions, he was granted special honor, praise and acclaim. Together with many other students, he departed from his homeland and arrived at Rapador. There, he received some teachings on Prajñāpāramitā texts and an authorization of red and yellow Mañjuśrī from Chöje Rinlo for several days.

Then, traveling via the Kong route, he gradually proceeded to Samye, Sangphu, and Lhasa, where he extensively performed the Seven-Branch Prayer and aspirations. Then he arrived at Lendra where the Omniscient Rongton was radiantly turning the wheel of dharma amidst an ocean-like assembly. His joy and devotion increased greatly, and he repeatedly developed respect thinking "All those gathered here are truly knowledgeable in scripture and reasoning."

When he first entered among the basic debate classes [bsdus ra ba], after a few days his level of realization was assessed. Then he joined the minor scripture classes and continued as before. Then he entered the intermediate scripture classes. As there were many detailed discussions with the sharp intermediate scripture students, he was told to focus on the intermediate scripture class. During that summer teaching session, he listened to all teachings given by Chöje Rongton from the teaching throne. When receiving the authorization of White Mahākrodha, Chöje Rongton said "Acala has dissolved into this Khampa leader of hundreds." This prophecy of being accepted by Acala was indeed a wondrous occurrence.

That autumn, a teacher named Lorin went to the Kyishö region for dharma empowerments as his assistant.

He met with Sherab Palden of Ling Mé and received the authorization of the Nāmasaṃgīti and the unique oral instructions on the recitation method of Dharmarājñī, which he then practiced. Then until the summer of the Snake year, he went to the Zé Chushul area for dharma empowerments, which greatly inspired him. He returned to Nālanda. At that time, he thought: "I need to study with a spiritual friend who is qualified to teach the entire Tripiṭaka and complete my studies. Chöje Rongton is no longer here. Who else would be suitable?" Then, recalling Chöje Rongton's earlier words: "You should study at Kharag Böndruk where our monk Jamchen Rabjampa established teachings and learning like thunder in the Dragon year," and also remembering Panchen Chöje's words:

"In the forest grove of Deyul Kyemö Tsal,
There is the spiritual friend Sangye Pel who teaches hundred treatises. Surrounded by intelligent and diligent disciples,
Day and night he proclaims the sound of dharma. "

As soon as he remembered these words, this supreme being's joy and devotion increased greatly, and like the excellent moon in a lake full of white lotuses, his determination to proceed without doubt became firm. When he was twenty-one years old in the Snake year, while traveling to Deyul Kyemö Tsal, he fell into the great whirlpool of the river when the rocky path of Rangchung was broken. He meditated on Sakya Paṇḍita at his crown and recited Dharmarājñī twenty-four times while staying [in the water]. Some travelers noticed him and pulled him out with a rope, safely rescuing him.

Then he went to Kyemö Tsal to meet the lord of scholars, Sangye Pel. At that time, one year had passed since the establishment of the Drayul monastic college. Seeing that the monks were well-disciplined and that teaching and learning were flourishing, he felt great joy and immediately began studying the major scriptures.

He listened to all the teachings being given on Pramāṇa, Vinaya, Abhidharma, and other texts. Due to his great intellectual capacity, strong dedication, and the excellent teaching of the learned master, combined with the power of the college's scholarly discourse, his understanding and analytical wisdom regarding all aspects of the Tripiṭaka expanded vastly like a summer lake. At that time, he studied numerous texts including:
1. The Five Dharmas of Maitreya with their commentaries
2. Logic texts:
   2.1 Pramāṇasamuccaya
   2.2 Pramāṇavārttika
   2.3 Pramāṇaviniścaya
   2.4 Hetubindu and other texts with their commentaries
3. Vinaya texts:
   3.1 Prātimokṣasūtra
   3.2 Vinayamūla
   3.3 Extensive Commentary
   3.4 Vinayasūtra and others
4. Abhidharma texts:
   4.1 Abhidharmasamuccaya
   4.2 Abhidharmakośa with commentary and many others
5. Madhyamaka texts:
   5.1 Mūlamadhyamakakārikā
   5.2 Madhyamakāvatāra
   5.3 Yukti corpus
   5.4 Vāda corpus
   5.5 Stavacorpus and many others
6. Additional texts:
   6.1 Bodhicaryāvatāra
   6.2 The Three Excellent Ones including Mañjuśrīnāmasaṃgīti

He didn't merely learn these texts by name, but retained them through the wisdom born of learning without forgetting, contemplated them through the wisdom born of reflection, and properly internalized them through the wisdom born of meditation. Through the power of completing his study and contemplation, he gained fearless confidence in all aspects of the Tripiṭaka, which amazed the entire assembly who declared, "This is certainly a holy being who has accumulated immeasurable previous training."

Those who discussed this said, "Even with great wisdom, such accomplishment would be impossible through training in this life alone." Jamchen Rabjampa was also extremely pleased and repeatedly offered praise, honor, and acclaim, calling him "the great-headed Khampa."

He requested the great patron who upholds the teachings with strength, Drungchen Norbu Zangpo, saying "I have this wise Khampa student who is a dedicated scholar. As he is expected to become a great geshe who will benefit the teachings in the future, please provide him with favorable conditions and protective guidance." Drungchen Norzangpa agreed and instructed the bodhisattva householder wearing five cotton robes, the great steward Ra Lo Dorje, saying "Do not let Gobo Rabjampa's clothing and provisions be lacking."

During his stay at Ngor, both teacher and student were allowed to receive monthly provisions from Samdrub Tse. The great steward accepted these instructions and provided support properly. Later, he also continuously offered materials for robes and other necessities.

When he reached twenty-five years of age, he received several cycles of teachings including Hayagrīva Chakralin from Chöje Gewa Gyaltshen.

At that time, when Chöje Gewa Gyaltshen and his disciples were holding their summer retreat, this lord and a geshe named Chakdor Gyaltshen engaged in debate. Based on the consequential argument (thal 'gyur) that this lord presented which could not be refuted...

At that time, when Chöje Gewa Gyaltshen and his disciples were holding their summer retreat, this lord and a geshe named Chakdor Gyaltshen engaged in debate. Based on the consequential argument (thal 'gyur) that this lord presented which could not be refuted, Chöje Gewa Gyaltshen was so pleased that he repeatedly explained the meaning of the scriptures. Then, in that same year's autumn, with strong aspiration to study the three tantras along with their oral instructions, and with unwavering devotion to Lord Vajradhara and his spiritual sons that moved his mind-stream, he thought: "I should primarily focus on practicing after receiving the profound dharmas of Vajrayāna from these masters. " With this intention, in the Bird year that winter, he went to glorious Ewam Chödén. It is said that just by seeing the face-maṇḍala of the venerable supreme Kunga Zangpo, he developed great joy and devotion as if attaining the first bhūmi, with his hair standing on end. From then until the fourth lunar month of the male Fire Dog year, for four years he stayed in close attendance, primarily receiving two transmissions of the precious Lamdré, explanations of the three Hevajra tantras, and related empowerments of Sambhuṭa and Dharmadhātu. At that time, during the supporting authorization, when instructed to blow the conch three times, the sound was extremely loud. [The master] said, "This accords with your fame and indicates you will benefit the teachings. "

The holy beings said, "This was the auspicious connection for his future enthronement as the lord of the teachings through blowing the dharma conch. "

From Lord Vajradhara, he received:
1. The Hevajra commentary empowerment according to the tradition
2. The Cakrasaṃvara Ḍākinī Ocean empowerment
3. The guidance for the four stages of Kṛṣṇayamāri
4. The guidance for the five stages of Guhyasamāja
5. Extensive explanation of the generation stage
6. The empowerment of five-deity Yamāntaka.

From Lord Vajradhara, he received the guidance and authorization of the Ultra-Unelaborate, the guidance on Freedom from Four Attachments, the songs on Freedom from Four Attachments composed by the Venerable One, the authorization of the guidance texts on Freedom from Four Attachments composed by Sakya Paṇḍita and Nubpa Rigdzin Drak, as well as the nine-deity Amitāyus empowerment, the hundred sādhanas, and various other authorizations like Ocean. He received countless mind-seal transmissions, oral instructions, and pith instructions. During this time, the night before he was to receive the Kurukulle authorization from Lord Vajradhara, this master had a dream in which a woman wearing red silk gave him a handful of fresh fruit saying "Eat this" and handed him a red drum saying "Beat this. " When he beat the drum, it seemed its sound pervaded the three thousand worlds. This was indeed the natural way in which the ḍākinīs blessed worthy vessels who were holy beings. Then in his twenty-sixth year, the Dog year, with Lord Kunga Zangpo as preceptor, the great bodhisattva Könchok Gyaltsen as karma master, and the disciplined bodhisattva Khacharwa Sangye Paldrub as secret preceptor, he received completely pure full ordination vows in the midst of a complete assembly of qualified monks. He maintained mindfulness without being tainted by even subtle infractions and faults.

At that time, he received numerous empowerments and authorizations including Guhyasamāja Akṣobhya from the great bodhisattva, as well as many transmissions of the Kangyur and others. From Khenchen Khacharwa, he received the empowerment of Condensed Families [Kurukulla], the empowerments of the twelve purification maṇḍalas, and the authorizations of Iron-Maned Hayagrīva and Uccharya. From Chöje Gungru Sherab Zangpo, he received the maṇḍala geometries and repeatedly heard teachings on the Differentiation of the Three Vows. He also received the Ocean of Ḍākinīs empowerment and the authorization of Great Red Gaṇapati. Furthermore, from both Dagchen Zhaluwa and Dagchen Chumigpa, he received the authorization of solitary Mahākāla in the Drogmi tradition and the authorization of Four-Faced Mahākāla. From Chöje Kunga Wangchuk, he received the Hevajra empowerment in the oral instruction tradition, the empowerment of the four Herukas in the Krishnacharya tradition, the Guhyasamāja-Mañjuśrī empowerment, the Guhyasamāja-Avalokiteśvara empowerment, the authorization of solitary Döndrak, the authorization of Eleven-Faced [Avalokiteśvara], the authorization of Blue Acala along with the water protector, the authorization of Four-Faced Mahākāla, and the authorization of the solitary hero Mahākāla in the Gayādhara lineage. Then in the Male Fire Mouse year, Muchen Könchok Gyaltsen was empowered as the regent of Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo. From then until the Hare year, he alternated residing between Mu and the Dharma seat of Ewam, and because this lord made unrelenting efforts to turn the wheel of Dharma as appropriate for each situation, [he gave] inconceivable profound and vast teachings.

He studied: the root and explanatory tantras of Cakrasaṃvara's Secret Culmination along with commentaries and transmissions of minor texts, the ripening empowerments of the Three Black Cycles, the blessing of Nāro Khecarī, the explanation of their generation stages, the four black stages of completion, the central channel, the five stages of the bell, and the blessing and guidance of White Cakrasaṃvara. Furthermore, he studied the root tantra with the Pearl Garland commentary, the General Conduct with Jetsün's commentary, and other related Indian and Tibetan texts on Cakrasamvara completely. From the Guhyasamāja cycle, in addition to the previous ones, he studied the root tantra commentary Clear Lamp with the Six Extremes Self-Luminosity, Indian texts composed by Nāgārjuna and his disciples, the three scrolls of Goes, and Goes's Great Thousand Topics. He received five sequences of guidance in the Path and Result of the Speech Lineage. During those occasions, he received the bodhicitta [vows] from both lineages, the cause-path empowerments, the Nairātmyā empowerment, blessings, and teachings on guidance texts as listed in the catalog volumes. Additionally, he received all the blessings, guidance, and transmissions according to the contents of Vajradhara's catalog, including the explanatory text commentaries of the Foundation Text - the Red Commentary and Black Volume - and the four profound dharmas that transcend the iron mountain which Virūpa directly bestowed upon Sachen, as well as other scattered biographies of masters and the Amazing Vision: A General Biography of the Gurus, along with the Subtle Vajra.

All the empowerments and instructions of the Path and Result including the notes on wedding rituals were received up to the level of practice authorization. From Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo, the great bodhisattva heard everything like filling a vase completely. He received the Hevajra empowerments of the four transmissions, and all related Indian and Tibetan texts completely. Furthermore, he heard: the root tantra Two Segments, Pure Commentary, the uncommon explanatory tantra Vajra Tent with its ornament, the common explanatory tantra Sampuṭa with its essential clarification, and their preliminaries General Analysis of Tantra Classes and Tree of Realization. He also received the empowerment of Seventeen-Deity Tārā and the empowerment of Yamāntaka in the Sa tradition. Additionally, he received the Eight Later Cycles of the Path, the Inconceivable, and the blessing of Mahāmudrā Without Letters. He also received the empowerment of Five-Deity Red Yamāri, the Very Unelaborate Completion Stage, along with Lotsāwa Globo's scattered instruction texts, the Unelaborate Beautiful Ornament, and all Indian texts composed by Vīryapa. Furthermore, he received the Sarvavid Death-Conquering and Amitāyus empowerments along with the explanation of the Purification Tantra. He also received the common and uncommon Mahākāla authorizations, Vijayaghāta, Arapacana, and Döndrak authorizations.

He received the empowerment for 100 sādhanas and the authorization of Avalokiteśvara transmitted from Kyergangpa. Furthermore, he studied: the Four Sections of Vinaya, the Prātimokṣa Sūtra, the Root Text [of Vinaya], its extensive commentary, the Karmaśataka, the Three Hundred Verses on Vinaya, and others. He also received transmissions of Atiśa's 100 Dharma Teachings, the Six Texts Known as Kadampa Classics, Atiśa's biography, commentary on the Seven Points of Mind Training, the Mind Training Peacock's Poison Destroyer, and about forty different mind training texts compiled into one small volume including the Weapon Wheel and others, along with Drogön Pelye's written notes on mind training, the mind training instructions composed by the great bodhisattva himself, Rongton Chöje's instruction manual on Prajñāpāramitā, and the complete instructions on the three cycles of Chöd transmitted from Dopa. Additionally, he received complete transmissions of the collected works of the Five Supreme Venerable Ones, Gyalse Thogmepa, Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo, and the great bodhisattva himself. Furthermore, he received the Madhyamaka bodhicitta [generation], Kamalaśīla's three stages of meditation - beginning, middle and end - and others. It should be known that these listed teachings are just a rough outline, and the teachings he received that are not included here are inconceivable in number, as stated in many biographies of this great being composed by many holy great beings. All these teachings he received were not merely oral transmissions, but were accompanied by precise understanding and practical application - when practiced they accomplished one's own benefit, and when taught they benefited others. In brief, having become the master of each of these teachings, he reached the far shore of the ocean of sūtra and tantra, becoming a crown ornament for many scholars.

The following is an account of his accomplishments: When his elder brother Yeshe Gyaltsen repeatedly urged him about needing to go to Kham, he thought, "Having served at the lotus feet of excellent spiritual guides for a long time, I have obtained profound and vast teachings encompassing both sūtra and tantra. Since definitive understanding has also arisen from the depths, now I should go to my homeland, meet my parents, and focus primarily on practice."

When the Male Iron Dragon year dawned as he turned thirty-two, the two brothers went to Deyul Kyemotsal. They visited the excellent spiritual guide Jamchen Rapjampa and rested there for a few days, thinking to set out on the eastern road.

At that time, during a tea gathering, Jamchen Rapjampa said, "Today, Rapjampa Sang Lhun should defend a thesis on the Abhidharmasamuccaya, Gowo Rapjampa should defend a thesis on the Differentiation of the Three Vows, and Katchu Tensel should defend a thesis on the Treasury of Valid Cognition."

When Tsethang Rapjampa Sangye Lhundup gave an explanation based on the cessation equipoise and mind and mental factors, making some doctrinal assertions, this lord engaged him in debate. After four or five consequential arguments, this lord stood up making three equally powerful logical arguments, and when he extended his hand, all the teachers and students present were amazed. They unanimously declared, "First, it became an excellent debate. Later, without having done formal study for about eight years, how could such excellent debate skills arise? It must be either meditation-born wisdom, swift speech, or blessing by the deity - it cannot be anything else."

Later, when Tsethang Rapjampa himself taught at Kyangdu and other places, Gowo Rapjampa repeatedly praised him as an excellent teacher. Then, Jamchen Rapjampa thought, "It would be a loss to send such a geshe to Kham. He would be suitable for our own monastery's seat." So he said to this lord, "Stay here and engage in teaching and study."

He secretly submitted a petition explaining the reasons for retention to both Drungchen Norzangpa and the Great Being Konchok Gyaltsenpa. While Drungchen Norzangpa strongly insisted that he must stay, when he earnestly requested permission to meet his parents and such, Jamchen Rapjampa said, "Since the Great Being is someone we both can consult with, let's submit the request and follow whatever instruction is given."

When they sent a petition to the Great Being, he replied, "Now that they have entrusted you with the care of the monastery seat, though it may be difficult to eventually obtain a monastery seat, staying in Ü-Tsang rather than going to Kham would be more beneficial for the doctrine and better in every way." Therefore, the elder brother Yeshe Gyaltsen was sent to Kham while he had to stay in Drepung.

Then, due to his renowned scholarly abilities, most students gathered around him, and he gave supplementary teachings. In the spring of the Snake year, he went to Chuzang Monastery for the summer teachings. At that time, two people came to request full ordination.

When Jamchen Rapjampa asked, "Have you ever attended the ritual assembly at Ngor?" He continued, "Since you need to teach tomorrow, you must memorize the ritual text from beginning to end."

Since I was young and had never attended the ritual assembly at Ngor, I merely requested to see the ritual text briefly. Then from that afternoon until the next morning's meditation session, I completely memorized all the necessary recitations for both being the preceptor for novice ordination and the karma master for full ordination from Buton's ritual text. The next morning, in the midst of the assembly, I flawlessly delivered both the preceptor's and karma master's ritual phrases with proper connections, without missing even half a word, along with the eleven instructions, free from verbal errors and without hesitation.

The omniscient Sangye Pel was extremely pleased and said to the other monks, "This must certainly be either wisdom arising from meditation or blessing from a yidam deity - such a thing is impossible for others."

Later, when the Horse year began, due to an epidemic that spread throughout Central Tibet, the monks had to focus solely on protective rituals. Both teacher and student entered into strict retreat, during which this lord primarily practiced the four-session Hevajra and the unelaborate Red Yamāntaka practices. At the end of the Horse year, when the diseases subsided, both teacher and student engaged in teaching, study, and debate. In the Sheep year, they were supposed to hold summer teachings at Chuzang Monastery.

However, this lord was struck by a severe illness and had to remain there.

While he had to stay there, due to Jamchen Rapjampa's great concern, he asked, "Have you not received any instructions at Ngor? Now maintain strict boundaries. By the time we return, either you should be dead or recovered. " He gave this stern advice with great care. Being extremely ill, [he thought], "For this illness, without seeking doctors or medical treatment, I will maintain only spiritual practice. When the teachers and students arrive, there must be a clear resolution whether I live or die. " At that time, in Ngakchang Rinchen Namgyal's dream, he was told that there was a king who was creating obstacles for this lama and that he needed to perform focused spiritual practice for this. So he meditated intensively on the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana. After several days, at dusk, the king's magical manifestations appeared. At that time, by focusing on the visualization of offering his body and resting in the view, the apparitions of obstacles naturally dissolved and his illness was completely cured. One night in a dream, he was before the Lord Mahasattva receiving empowerment. From offering the mandala of approach to the vajra master empowerment of the vase initiation, everything was extremely clear in the dream. He received the vase empowerment, and when it was said "The bodily defilements are purified," he awoke. Hoping the remaining [empowerments] would still come, he tried to return to sleep, but the continuation of the previous dream did not occur. It is said that the statement "The bodily defilements are purified" was likely a sign of being freed from illness. During these times, many extraordinary signs occurred, such as realizing the equality of existence and peace, and so forth.

At this time, based on historical accounts, he could defeat even remaining Māra's forces. Then at the end of that year, Jamchen Rapjampa said, "I am going to request remaining teachings from the Great Being at Mus for about a year. During that time, Gowo Rapjampa will act as my substitute, and you should teach the dharma. The monks should also make offerings to him." The omniscient Sangye Pel departed for Mus.

Afterwards, this lord diligently engaged in comprehensive study, from memorizing the great volumes of the Tripitaka including Pramāṇa, Vinaya, and Abhidharma up to counting their summaries. This generated tremendous understanding appropriate to the three levels of intelligence - superior, middling and lesser. The monks developed deep conviction that the student was more learned than the teacher, and his reputation for scholarship spread throughout the Land of Snows.

At that time, he also gave empowerments of the five deities of Yamāntaka and Red Yamāntaka. He also composed there the verse biography of Muchen, two praises to the omniscient Sangye Pel, a general commentary on the Three Vows, and "Clear Understanding of the Mother's Meaning."

Regarding the account of establishing the teaching center: It is said that through the power of previous aspirations of holy beings, when they undertake any virtuous activities for the benefit of beings, all the outer, inner and secret interdependent connections align and they are accomplished excellently.

At the end of the Monkey year, when the omniscient Sangye Pel was preparing to return from Mus, the Great Being instructed, "Let Drungpa stay longer to receive teachings, and send Gowo Rapjampa up." Based on this command, as soon as the omniscient Sangye Pel arrived at Drepung, this lord, at the age of thirty-seven in the Bird year, went to Mus to meet the Great Being.

During the Bird year, he received many profound and extensive teachings including the Path and its Fruit [Lamdre] and others. He himself also taught countless dharma teachings including the Sakya Kabum to many earnest students. He also composed a commentary on the versified biography of the Great Being, the praise "Precious Jewel," two praises to Lord Kunga Zangpo, the ritual for practicing the four dharmas of Bhikshuni Palmo, and responses to objections regarding Guhyasamāja.

At that time, the Jamchen tulku Kunga Tashi was also there receiving teachings. The tulku said, "We need a spiritual friend like you who benefits the doctrine through teaching and study. I will provide whatever support is needed, so it would be good to establish a teaching center." This lord found this agreeable, and after requesting the Great Being's approval, he made an excellent commitment to establish a teaching center. That night, in Jamchen Choje's dream, someone was building a great dharma throne. When asked who it was for, they said it was for Lord Drakpa Gyaltsen. The next day, when the three - teacher and students - met, Jamchen Choje explained about his dream and formally offered to support the teaching center.

Following his agreement with the three - teacher and students - the Great Being was very pleased and said the auspicious connections were excellent, and they firmly decided to establish a teaching center.

Then, in the Dog year, when the Great Being Konchok Gyaltsen was invited to Ngamring, this great being also went there in his retinue. In the manner of supplementary teaching, he gave thorough explanations of the Three Tantras, extensive explanations of the Domsum Rabye, explanations of the Hevajra Tantra, empowerments of Vajrabhairava and others to many important Geshes led by the teachers of Ngamring Monastery. He also gave many practical instructions and extensive explanations of the Purification Tantra.

After carefully examining the points raised in Bodong Choklé's critique of Zhenphen Özer, he composed "Harmful Destroyer of Zhenphen," a refutation regarding Kunrik, and after carefully examining Dakpo Chöpé's critique of "Essential Moonlight," he then composed "Essential Illuminator" and a sadhana in the Vajrabhairava tradition.

At that time, based on this great being's wisdom manifesting like a mandala of the sun in the lotus garden of the scriptural center of Ngamring, his excellent reputation spread in all directions. Then, when he went to teach upon being invited by the Jamchen tulku, he made aspirations while holding the lotus feet of the Great Victor of Mus on his crown. At that time, Great Mus also made aspirations before the root and lineage gurus, yidams, dakinis and dharma protectors, [saying] that in general, for the Buddha's doctrine...

Following aspirations for the Buddha's doctrine in general and particularly the glorious Sakya tradition's teachings regarding the study and teaching of sutra and tantra, he advised to protect from obstacles and accomplish favorable conditions. He performed countless physical practices including bodily movements, granted numerous gifts such as hundreds of nectar pills and thousand-stone offerings, and appointed him as the supreme dharma regent upholding the Victor's teachings. Then this Great Being went before the Jamchen tulku and undertook a retreat at Serkha Ding, where he practiced the approach of Samvara Lopawa and performed the sadhana of Lama Rinchen until achieving signs of accomplishment. At the conclusion, he also composed a supplication to Lama Rinchen called "Increasing Merit. "

Then he traveled to Tsang region. After staying for several days at Samdrup Tse, while traveling upward, he met someone at Yuba Dong carrying a gandi who said he was selling this gandi. Saying this was an auspicious connection, he measured and purchased that gandi and carried it upward. Then he arrived at Serling, where the precious tulku and the dharma king Döndrub Dorje, who upholds the teachings with power, along with their disciples, arranged favorable conditions. In the Male Fire Dog year, on the fifteenth day of the month under the star Pushya, they established the monastic college with about forty students, thus first establishing the auspicious connections for spreading the teachings. Furthermore, Lord Tulku sold a good horse and offered provisions including one thousand measures of goat wool.

Without altering Drung Chenpa Norzangpa's intention, Tsangchen Döndrub Dorje offered a monetary endowment and established regular summer and winter provisions for both teachers and students. Master Yungpa Tsewang Tashi also offered provisions from Dzong Dong, and from the very beginning, having repeatedly received teachings on longevity, Mahakala, and others, he served the lamas in an excellent way.

At the beginning of the composition of the monastic rules he authored, [he wrote]: "Regarding our system of teaching and learning - since Lord Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo was very pleased with the teaching and learning of the Tripitaka, and since the Great Being of Mus directly commanded to establish firmly the teaching and learning of sutra and tantra, Dharma Lord Sönam Chökyi Kunga Tashi Gyaltshen Palzangpo provided the patronage. This establishment of Tanak Serling Monastery on the fifteenth day of the month under the star Pushya in the Male Fire Dog year was done: 
1. For the general spread of the Buddha's doctrine
2. Particularly to prevent the essential points of the excellent philosophical tradition from declining
3. For myself to focus on becoming familiar with the words and meaning of the Buddha's teachings

Apart from these, there were no main motivations that were either non-virtuous or neutral. The reason for this can be understood from how the dharmic teaching and learning increased up until I reached eight years of age. From then until as long as this tradition of teaching and learning continues..."

Here resides a brief description of the conduct of the sangha members:

In general, one must follow the lineage of blessings, ultimate view, conventional tenets, methods of scriptural commentary, and all practices of explanation and accomplishment according to the tradition of the lord Sakyapas, the father and sons, who are the masters of the teachings in the Land of Snows. In particular, regarding the methods of practice for diligently pursuing the teaching and learning of the Tripitaka, one must rely on the practices established by the two lords of scholars Yagdrong, the lord of wisdom Drakpa Zangpo, and his eldest spiritual son, my teacher, the lord of speech Sangye Pel.

The meaning of these instructions is to briefly explain: under whose patronage this monastic college was established, when it was established, where it was established, for what purpose it was established, along with its rules of conduct. At that time, the Omniscient Namsöd said: "This monastic college will definitely be established as something unrivaled. Last year in my dream, there was a great encampment at the base of Danag mountain. When I asked whose encampment it was, I was told it was the encampment of the Gur Gön of Sakya. This seems to refer to the establishment of the monastic college at Serling by Gobo Rabjampa." Later, in the Pig year, when Chöje Dönyö Palwa strongly urged that this great being should teach both at Zelung, making his request before the Great Being, the Great Being took two days to contemplate it.

Then in the Female Water Hare year's autumn, when the Dharma King Dönyö Dorje was residing in the officials' guest house, this master was invited. They showed him greater worldly respect than before, such as offering him an elevated seat. They also established summer and winter provisions better than before.

At that time, when Rinchen Tsepa and others initiated a rebellion, the officials issued a reprimand after deliberation. Rinchen Tsepa's monastery had to be destroyed. The officials went to Rinchen Tse. At that time, while this master was staying at Ngor, based on receiving an urgent letter requesting his immediate presence, he promptly went to Serling.

Then, accompanied by six or seven attendants including Panchen Wangchuk Drupa and Je Sangye Rinchen, he arrived and initially stayed in the northern chamber. The next day he met with the administrator. After that, he went to inspect the assembly hall. There was no timber at all. This master sat leaning against the wall at the upper end of the right-side row and said, "In the future, will there be old senior scholars who are poor teachers sitting like this?" Later, after three or four years, during a general tea gathering, when a Sakya Madhyamika scholar called Drakzang was sitting exactly as had been described, Panchen Wangchuk Drupa thought to himself that the earlier statement had been a clear prophecy.

A master like Dönyö Palwa alone should not be relied upon. He established exactly what was taught when [previous masters] like Sakya Pandita and Butön Rinpoche set the example of firmly establishing explanations of both sutra and tantra. This generated extraordinary faith.

Then, when the officials and teachers granted the basic allowances, they discussed that it would be good if they could offer just enough [facilities] to stay in the assembly hall and residence. They said to perform a five-day torma ritual. After performing the five-day torma ritual, with no particular issues arising, he departed.

Then in the eleventh lunar month, when the governor and officials went to Rikhud, one day an invitation came. While staying at Rikhud Monastery, a steward came before him and said, "According to the governor's command, when the Khenpo Rabjampa came from Kham and stayed at Ngor and in all other circumstances, the Great Tathagata provided support through offering robes and such. In general, this benefited the Buddha's teachings, and specifically, in our domain here, he gave vast teachings and transmissions. We hoped he would become either a regular teacher or a singular master.

Having kept this intention in mind, we tried to offer whatever service we could. Just as birds won't gather without a nest, we thought a self-sustaining place for teaching and study was needed, but previously there hasn't been a convenient way to make offerings. Regarding this, although our governor is constantly engaged in military affairs, he tries not to harm monasteries and the sangha. Yesterday, due to the bad behavior of Rinchen Tsepa's monks, that monastery up there was destroyed, which is deeply regrettable. Now that needs to be restored."

Having said "Now what's needed is to restore it. Just having the full number of yellow-robed monks is not enough - we need someone who can uphold the teachings through explanation and practice. Since we are offering you that religious center up there, there's no need to keep repeating requests. You must give your word of acceptance based on this single request now," he respectfully asked. In accordance with the response given to this request, the governor made arrangements, and [the master] replied "I also need a monastery, so please keep this in mind."

Having made this request accordingly, there was great joy and laughter. Then on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, along with the ceremonial tea, this great being was enthroned as master of the teachings. That day, the great scholar Śākya Lodrö and Rabjampa Gönpo Wangchuk both arose for dharma discussions. Śākya Lodrö gave extensive explanations, and Gönpo Wangchuk presented unparalleled consequentialist arguments, which delighted all the assembled bright minds. This great being himself bestowed the name "Complete Victory of the Buddha's Teaching" [Thubten Namgyal] to the religious center.

After making brief calculations, he departed. Then in his forty-fifth year, the female water snake year, in the second month, he arrived at Thubten Namgyal and instructed the petitioners to do good construction work on the assembly hall and private quarters. He granted some building sites and plots of land to various people. He had the intention to have the assembly hall's door face east.

After considering the intention, with Paṇchen Wangchuk Drubpa and other spiritual friends acting as attendants, he performed an extensive earth ritual. Through diligent work on both general and specific construction projects from the perspective of unattached study, it is said the monastery gradually developed.

Then, regarding the liberation story of spreading the teachings, Noble Regent Wangchuk Drubpa stated:
"In daytime spread teachings through explanation, debate and composition,
At night single-pointedly meditate on profound yoga,
Never wavering from the three intentions,
I bow to the root and branches of the Omniscient One's teachings."

In accordance with this meaning, this great being's daily routine of dharma practice was as follows:

Generally, after the evening session, he would rest in the state of clear light through sleeping yoga. Then rising early in the morning through awakening yoga, he would first do the common and uncommon Virudhaka practices. Then he would perform the profound guru path practice and the Nāro Khechari meditation. After that, an extensive path-time practice, followed by prāṇāyāma yoga with recitation, and then would recite many dhāraṇī mantras like the Vijaya-destroying one without attachment. At dawn, he would briefly review the major texts to be taught that day. Then after rising and performing the four white deeds, he would make offerings. Immediately after, whatever dharma arose, he would ascend the dharma throne and teach extensive texts on valid cognition and whichever later pusti was appropriate, giving whatever teachings suited the wishes of the students.

After ascending the Dharma throne, he would give whatever teachings suited the wishes of the students devoted to study. Then he would bestow various tantric teachings, including oral instructions and mantra teachings as appropriate. At midday he would return inside for the midday session and meal. Immediately after the midday meal, whatever Dharma arose and again ascending the Dharma throne - during short winter days he would not give general teachings, but once the days grew slightly longer, he would teach general Dharma including Vinaya, Bodhicaryāvatāra, Śikṣāsamuccaya, mind training and such teachings. Then he would give a summary of the Pramāṇa texts, whichever later pusti was suitable, and general overviews and such, speaking according to the various intellectual capacities and interests of the monk students devoted to study. Afterwards he would also teach one of the extremely profound Vajrayāna teachings. Then returning inside, from the time of striking the gaṇḍī for Dharma practice, he would remain single-pointedly in meditation. This included the extensive path-time practice, the yogas of Kṛṣṇa Cakrasaṃvara and both Ghaṇṭapāda and Yamāntaka five deities in an extremely unelaborate form, the profound guru path yoga, and many sessions of meditation and mantra recitation on Nāro Khechari and others. Afterwards he would perform extensive torma offerings and dedications to the yidams and dharma protectors. Then he would do the two Indrabhūti protector practices. Then through sleeping yoga he would rest single-pointedly in clear light, and again rise through awakening yoga and so forth as mentioned before. In brief, at all times he never let his three doors remain ordinary.

During retreat periods, he would maintain the previous sequence of meditation practices as a foundation, and on top of that would also perform empowerments, permissions, consecrations, fire pujas, and composition of treatises.

He composed treatises and taught both profound and vast Vajrayāna dharma, thus continuously turning the wheel of enlightened activity. In general, since great scholars illuminate the teachings through the three scholarly activities, this great being also spread the Buddha's teachings extensively through explanation, debate, and composition. To briefly describe how he spread the Buddha's teachings like rays of the sun through explanation:

He bestowed empowerments such as:
1. The four transmission lineages of Hevajra
2. Path empowerment of the instruction lineage

4. His own collected works and countless others

Regarding explanations of scriptural texts:

2. Higher and Lower Abhidharma
3. Five Collections of Reasoning translated in Tibet including Mūlamadhyamakakārikā
4. Madhyamakāvatāra
5. Catuḥśataka
6. Bodhicaryāvatāra
7. Vinayasūtra
8. Pramāṇavārttika
9. Pramāṇaviniścaya
10. Differentiation of the Three Vows

Regarding these scriptural texts of the collections (Piṭakas), he thoroughly mastered them through general commentaries, difficult point commentaries and so forth until reaching certainty. As for mere explanatory transmissions he gave, many holy beings unanimously stated that they were beyond counting, including the Bodhisattvabhūmi, Śikṣāsamuccaya and others.

Regarding how he illuminated the Buddha's teachings through debate: In general, there were many who spoke wrongly about the Buddha's teachings. The holy beings up through the great Sakya master refuted these and established the stainless teachings. From when the great Sakya master passed to another realm until the composition of the Differentiation of the Three Vows, wrong views that arose were refuted by the Differentiation of the Three Vows itself, establishing the stainless teachings. This is clear in the great treatise Differentiation of the Three Vows itself. After that, various other later holy beings also somewhat clarified this.

In particular, the great Vajradhara of the degenerate age prophesied by the Victor in sutras, the holy being Kunga Zangpo, from previous lives was not guided by false spiritual friends who spoke completely wrong views unprecedented in India or Tibet regarding the general teachings of the Buddha and particularly the unmistaken philosophical tenets spread by the earlier Sakya masters, and who in this life were prophesied by meditation deities regarding the methods of

In particular, regarding some false spiritual friends who incorrectly explained the very profound essential points of the basis of purification and methods of purification, this great master arranged everything exactly as in the earlier position without excess or omission. He then thoroughly refuted them by clearly showing how they contradicted scripture, reasoning, and their own assertions. He composed works like "Moonbeams on the Essential Points of the Supreme Vehicle that Distinguishes Views" which clearly establishes the philosophical tenets of the earlier masters with valid reasoning.

Furthermore, when some took on the task of composing a text called "Ocean of Suchness," claiming it was prophesied by meditation deities, and wrongly criticized the writings of the Venerable Precious Grags pa's feet regarding essential points, this great master thoroughly refuted them and composed the treatise "Destroyer of Harm to Others" which extensively explained the presentations of scripture and reasoning.

Moreover, when some made numerous arguments criticizing the meaning of the words in the "Commentary Moonbeams" through finding contradictions, he defeated them through scripture and reasoning and composed treatises like "Refuting Wrong Views About Vajrayāna, which Clarifies the Supreme Guide's Intent."

Later, when some antagonistic ones interpreted the ultimate view of sutra and tantra as Mind-Only and mostly incorrectly interpreted the meaning of the words of the Differentiation of the Three Vows from among all the writings of the glorious Sakya Paṇḍita, particularly the text of the Differentiation of the Three Vows, this great intellect refuted each of their assertions point by point.

He composed a work called "Dispelling Confusion About the Three Vows" which explains the meaning of the words of the Differentiation of the Three Vows in accordance with the intent of the Buddha's teachings. He also composed "Clarifying the Ground, Path and Result" which elucidates the correct philosophical tenets and refutes those who spoke wrongly about the practice lineage from when Sakya Paṇchen passed to another realm until the composition of the Supplement to the Three Vows. Additionally, he composed "Illumination of the Excellent Path: A Commentary on the Meaning of Sunlight of Perfect Methods" which specifically refutes confusion about the essential points of view.

In this text, when refuting those with wrong views about the system of view, he extensively refuted them by showing nine contradictions that would fall upon the earlier proponent, including that the upper and lower cannot be unified and that the presentation of the four tenets would be impossible.

Furthermore, during his analysis of the great treatises, he defeated the force of others' wrong views and generated certainty in intelligent followers. Regarding his manner of directly debating others: At Skyed mos tshal, when the famous and highly learned scriptural master Tsethang Rabjampa Sangye Lhundrup established some philosophical tenets contradicting scripture with audacity, this great being defeated him through the power of reasoning and established him in the discipline of silence.

Here at Skyemos Monastery, the omniscient Dharma King Sangye Pel and all the scripture-holders present paid homage to this master through praise, respect, and veneration, recognizing him as one who possessed wisdom arising from meditation, or as one definitely blessed by meditation deities. Even Tsethang Rabjampa himself later repeatedly said that Gobo Rabjampa was an excellent teacher. For these and many other reasons mentioned above, there is no doubt that he was able to defeat all opponents, both his own and others', through the method of debate that establishes proofs and refutes arguments.

As it is said:
"On the high snow mountain of merit and wisdom,
Loudly roaring the pure scripture and reasoning,
Making evil speakers' groups cower while the wise
Become victorious lions protecting deer."

Regarding how he opened the lotus of composition of sacred texts and made the Buddha's teachings clear like daylight: Although noble ones dwelling on the grounds of Mahāyāna can interpret the intent of Buddha's words independently, in order to prevent later followers from composing arbitrarily, he composed treatises that serve as commentaries on the intent of both sutra and tantra texts. Their enumeration is as follows:

   1. 3. Torma ritual

Through his great effort in establishing Mañjuśrī practice and offerings, these spread throughout Tibet until the present day. Regarding this, Panchen Chöje said:
"The eight-branched Mañjuśrī river flow
Coming from the unfrozen ocean of Ewam,
Was drunk from Kunga Wangchuk's vase
By Sönam Senge with a ladle of hearing. If not quenched and spread widely,
This tradition, like water in a dry well,
Would now remain in name only. Yet through this supreme being's power,
It spread throughout this land of snow. Therefore, supreme friends, learned beings,
According to the omniscient guru's intent,
Maintain this tradition and spread it to others. "

There are many other compositions written at different times and places, as clarified above and below. All these compositions were blessed by the gurus and deities, and continuously protected by the Dharma protectors, as will be explained below. These activities of teaching, debate and composition were harmonious with the common traditions.

The unique [teachings] were presented in an unmixed way that was easy to understand for beginners and easy to retain, while for learned scholars who had trained extensively, it was captivating and humbling - this was confirmed through experience, as stated by holy beings who remained impartial. Regarding how he turned the wheel of Dharma in other places: In the male Fire Dog year, following the year of establishing the monastic college, in the spring of the Pig year, he gave empowerments at Drakmar Chöde. That autumn and the following Mouse year's spring teachings were given at Dokhar. Then teacher and students went together to make offerings to the Great Being, and received some instructions. That summer, he turned a vast wheel of Dharma at the great Jamchen monastery. Then in the spring of the Ox year, he gave summer teachings at Dokhar. At Jamba's mandala and composed the root text of "Essential Profound Meaning. " The commentary was composed later after arriving at Thubten Namgyal. Then in the Tiger and Dragon years, he gave summer teachings at Gawa Tsal, composing a praise to Tārā during the first session. Between those two, in the Hare year, he gave summer teachings at Dokhar. From the female Water Snake year through the male Fire Monkey year - a period of four years - he traveled between Thubten Namgyal and Serling monasteries, giving summer teachings at Dokhar. In the twelfth month of the Bird year, he traveled from Do to Thropur and stayed for two days. At Thropur, with general tea offerings from the Chöje and three tea offerings from the general administration, he made vast aspiration prayers.

Then in the male Earth Dog year, he established a fifteen-day teaching session at Dokhar, taking half provisions. On the ninth day, he departed and made offerings before Dagchen Lodrö Wangchuk at Shab Med. There, all teachers and students received transmissions of Mañjuśrī Arapacana, Thubten Serkhang-ma, and others. Then he went to Thropur, offered butter lamps and made extensive aspiration prayers. Then as the sun was setting on the thirteenth day, he arrived near the great monastic seat of glorious Sakya. At that time, many senior monks led by the administrator Rabjam Jampa Senge came to welcome him. The lord himself said to the horsemen accompanying him, "Since this is the great monastic seat, dismount your horses. " The three masters and others dismounted their horses while making offerings. Then at the great temple and Dan Zik, all teachers and students dismounted and made offerings, prostrating repeatedly. At that time, due to the power of his vast renowned fame, all the lay and ordained people of that area gathered. Although it seemed impossible to escape the crowd of blessing-seekers due to their great numbers, the monks who went ahead joined hands, enabling everyone to receive blessings while he arrived safely at the great monastic seat. Then he stayed at the eastern residence of Zimkhang Labrang. The next day, on the fourteenth, in commemoration of Sakya Paṇḍita, he had excellent tea served to over two thousand resident and visiting monks at that great monastic institution.

I will now start the translation:

He made offerings to the great master Rinpoché Shérap Gyaltsen from India. For each lama such as the leader of hundreds [brgya dpon] and others, he made arrangements. To each monk, he distributed ritual cards [ka da kha do] in their rows. For the two religious sessions held there, the first provisions were offered by the Lhasa District [rdzong], and the second by several high-ranking servants of the Great Temple. From the beginning of the teaching sessions, both morning and evening, while maintaining pure explanation and listening of sūtras and tantras, wealthy residents generally invited about thirty gathered masters and disciples for both meals. Whatever butter was offered, along with many butter lamps offered from various general and specific sources, made that year's butter lamp offerings particularly excellent. It is said that from then on, the tradition of butter lamp offerings continued to flourish. He continuously made offerings and aspirational prayers before famous sites like the Old Central Tower [dbu rtse rnying ma] and Great Temple, and performed offering rituals and activities at famous protector chapels like Gorum and others. During the teaching period, when water gathered, he was invited and made extensive offerings of barley and other things. To all the patrons and servants, both high and low ranking, who were present there, he gave the bodhicitta generation of Mahāyāna. Led by Master Sangye Gyatso and others, he granted empowerments and permissions for Yamāntaka, Vajrabhairava, and others, making them thoroughly satisfied.

At Khau Kyedlha, he met with Dagchen Lodrö Gyaltsen Palzangpo, who was in strict retreat at Phagpa Dragphug. From him, he received the permissions for Düdgyal and Karmo Nyizla. That evening, he performed extensive torma offerings and fulfillment rituals at the shrine of Four-Faced Mahākāla.

During the fulfillment ritual, when an arrow with a prayer flag fell at the throne, Dagchen said it was a sign of siddhis being granted by Mahākāla and that it was fine to keep it. It was exchanged for a black pleasant silk, and that flag is now used as the roof flag at Thubten Namgyal.

At that time, the compassionate one of Kyedlha's Öma was bowing his head toward the throne. Wönpo Namkha Nyingpo directly witnessed this as a sign of accomplishing activities as commanded.

At that time, Dagchen Rinpoche spoke many symbolic phrases including "The unsurpassed direction transforms those with eyes." While there was an explanation of the first symbolic verse, he asked if there might be some oversight since there were no previous explanations of the remaining verses. When told that there had not been any previous oversight, he went to Sakya. There, he invited the statue of Jetsün made by Nango Jé Shinjé Drag to the east palace and made extensive offerings for seven days.

He said that understanding arose freely after making prayers, and composed "The Glorious Granter of Definitive Symbolic Explanation." He said the scribe for this was Paṇḍita Wangchuk Drubpa.

Having been invited by the lord of scholars Müsepa Dorje Gyaltsen and others, there were extensive pleasant conversations. After arriving at Thubten Namgyal, he responded to exceptionally well-composed questions containing many doubts of the discriminating ones based on the works of the Venerable Supreme One, generating certainty through answers consistent with the Supreme One's works. At the great monastic seat and its branches, all the monks and lay practitioners regarded him as the actual Buddha and accordingly: some took refuge, some took vows to abstain from killing, some took novice and full ordination vows, some received bodhicitta vows and empowerments. In particular, on the morning of the Great Miracle Festival [cho 'phrul chen bco lnga], in the presence of Venerable Mañjuśrī, he gave the Madhyamaka bodhicitta generation to all gathered people.

In the evening, he gave the permission ritual of orange Mañjuśrī to the assembled monks who were participating in the prayer festival. Then on the seventeenth day, he departed and was invited to Zhichen. He made aspirational prayers before the statue of Ārya Rinpoche. That afternoon, he went to Lugru Palden where, led by Chöje Södgönpa, they arranged provisions for ten days and established teachings. Then he went to Mugulung and made extensive butter lamp offerings and aspirational prayers before the statue of Drogmi Lotsāwa. Then, invited by Darpa Nangsö, he fully ordained one abbot of a monastery under Darpa's authority and one Dharma teacher from Zurtso. He was also invited to both Tshowo and Donglhatse. At Lhartse, he extensively performed observations, aspirational prayers, and torma offerings at the sacred objects and protector chapel.

At Sagthang Ding the next day, he performed extensive offerings and aspirational prayers at the stūpa of Zhingönpa. Then, he gradually proceeded to Thubten Namgyal. At that time, the local people requested, "Just as you gave the bodhicitta generation at Sakya, please grant it to us as well." To all those gathered for the Three Vows teaching [sdom gsum chos khrid], he gave an extensive Madhyamaka bodhicitta generation, and also performed excellent temporary and lasting auspicious aspirational prayers.

Then in the first lunar month of the Rat year, having been invited by the patrons Chökyong and Bö, he established a one-month teaching session at Thropur. This was the first teaching session at Thropur. Thromdawa came to Thropur to make offerings and offered good cushions and threshold wood to the monks. From the Ox year onwards, he also made a commitment to regularly support the monastic college. Then he held the first winter teachings of the Ox year at Dokhar. Afterwards, in the first lunar month, both Thromdawa and Chökyong Bö offered provisions, and the teachings and prayers at Thropur increased greatly. In connection with this, Kachupa Sönam Gyaltsen from Singshong offered provisions.

From that Iron-Female-Ox year until the Earth-Female-Bird year, for nine years, Thromdawa and Chökyong Bö sponsored the teaching sessions. Specifically, regarding how he spread the teachings at the Dharma center of Ewam: In the Iron-Female-Ox year, when Dagchen Lodrö Wangchuk passed away at Chumig, for his memorial services, monks from Ngor, Thubten, and Zilung were invited.

At that time, with Chöje Palden Dorje as abbot, Paṇchen Śākya Chogpa as karma master, and this master himself as secret preceptor, they fully ordained Drölmawa Chöje Sönam Palchog and others. Then at Ewam Chöden, with Chöje Palden Dorje as abbot, this master as karma master, and Master Sönam Sangye as secret preceptor, they fully ordained Yongdzin Könchog Pelwa and others. That autumn, Chöje Palden Dorje was installed at the seat of Ngor. When he departed for Sakya, that winter a Ngor representative came to Thubten Namgyal and earnestly presented reasons why this great master should come to the seat of Ewam Chöden. This master thought: "Although it would harm the continuous explanations and study of sūtra and tantra and the flourishing monk assembly at Thubten Namgyal if I went to Ngor, it might work if there was no one to maintain the master's monastery." In particular, he recalled a previous dream where many monks from Ewam were carrying loads and going south through Lachung pass. This master struck a gaṇḍī from above the Ngor assembly hall, and those monks turned back. He had a vision of teaching them Dharma. He also remembered the auspicious connections made during Vajradhara's bestowal of the Saṃpuṭa empowerment and permission.

When Gyaltsab Kunga Wangchuk was about to depart for Ngari, he instructed me to uphold the view and tenets of the previous masters and to be vigilant and diligent regarding the monastery. Keeping this in mind and thinking the time had come, he agreed to teach the Lamdre and other teachings at Ewam. From the Dharma session at Dokhar, in the Tiger year, he proceeded to receive the Lamdre teachings from the Omniscient Precious One at Ngor. Paṇchen Wangchuk Drubpa and other masters served as ritual leaders, and a large assembly of monks attended the Dharma session. That year, this great master extensively taught the Lamdre and many other teachings at Ewam Chöden. Then he went to Thubten Namgyal and properly established all necessary rules and regulations for the monastic college. On the day he was to depart for the seat of Ewam, a light snow fell. That night in a dream, he was sitting on a Dharma throne teaching to many people. At the four directions around that throne were the Indian paṇḍitas Nāgārjuna, Āryadeva, Vasubandhu, and Dignāga, who respectively recited: "I bow to the supreme precious heap of instructions, dwelling in the ocean of merit, the lion's throne of excellent exposition, the lord of mountains of qualities. "

Considering this an especially auspicious connection, he entered the assembly. The master himself was very pleased and arrived with many wonderful omens. When it came time on the fifth day of the first lunar month of the Hare year, during an auspicious planetary and stellar configuration, he was installed on that lion throne of the holy Dharma of Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo of the degenerate age.

Many auspicious verses from gods and humans were recited, and flowers were showered like rain. He was enthroned as the great royal teacher, and fortunate disciples as numerous as particles in the ocean placed him like a precious crown jewel upon their heads.

Then for four years until the Male Fire-Horse year, first at Ewam he thoroughly bestowed the paths of liberation connected with each class of tantra, including empowerments, the two stages, auxiliary blessing rituals, and the nine profound stages of guidance. In particular, he completely taught the nectar of speech of the lord of yogis Virūpa - the precious oral teachings of the Path with its Result including all its branches. As support for these, he excellently taught the three Hevajra tantras in a thorough and extensive manner.

In brief, he taught countless profound and vast Dharma teachings of the Vajrayāna. He repeatedly gave the bodhisattva vow according to the Madhyamaka tradition and mind training of the Mahāyāna. He turned the minds of disciples toward the Dharma and established innumerable disciples on the authentic path through ordination and other means.

During these occasions, after completing the offering ritual of the time of Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo, he went to Thubten Namgyal and taught profound and vast Dharma. He then returned to Ewam where he performed extensive offerings during the earth offering ceremony and taught appropriate teachings to different people. In the tenth lunar month, he went to Thubten Namgyal.

In the winter season, he performed the extensive offering ritual of Muchen's time, conducted the ritual recitations for longevity, and gave necessary instructions regarding the rules for establishing Dharma sessions. The three masters - Lopön Rinpoche Sönam Gyatso, Paṇchen Wangchuk Drubpa, and Muspa Rabjampa Thukje Palzang - initiated teaching and study sessions, causing the doctrine to flourish without decline from before. 

Upon returning to Ewam Chöden, he taught various aspects of Dharma including the Precious Speech [gsung ngag]. During these occasions, many disciples gathered from Ü, Tsang, Kham, and Ngari regions. All the offering materials that rained down from faithful devotees, he did not take for himself in the slightest but allocated them to whatever was needed for the labrang's supplies, for the five-fold offerings and single offerings, and for sending Dharma encouragement missions to the Dokham region, which he included in his spiritual commitments.

Although we had established strong teaching and study sessions of mainly the Tripiṭaka as well as mantra at the monastery of Thubten Nampar Gyalwa at Tanak Rinchen Tse, due to persistent requests from the senior Ngor masters that their monastery's monks needed to serve as administrators, this could not be refused. Remembering the incomparable kindness shown even by small portions of how the guru and his sons worked for the Buddha's teachings, and although there was concern about what would happen here in the future, finding no other alternative and unable to mentally abandon it, he accepted the responsibility of the seat from the fifth day of the first month of the Hare year.

Having delivered instructions and sermons, the offered tea, robes, silk, and such were placed at the seat of Dor. In that same Horse year, when he reached Ewam Chöden, the tradition of making offerings at Ewam Chöden was established from then on. He showed great kindness and service to those of Ewam Chöden.

Then, during the great festival on the twenty-fifth day of the first month of the Male Fire-Horse year, as prophesied by the three father-son Vajradharas, he enthroned his heart-son, the tutor Könchok Pelwa, as the regent. After giving instructions that extensive activities for the doctrine must be carried out, with great joy he proceeded to Thubten Namgyal where he spread the teachings through explanation and practice.

In the summer of the Hare year, having been invited by the Bodongpas, there was a very large assembly at Bodong Er Chödbar. During the Dharma teachings, a great shower of flowers fell, and he became an object of worship for gods and humans. Everyone considered this wondrous, as stated by holy beings. When I stayed at Bodong Er, an elderly monk named Gelong Draködpa from the northern residence where he had studied at Jagö Shong also said that during Go Rabjampa's Dharma teachings at Bodong, great showers of flowers would fall during each teaching session. This gave me deep conviction.

At that time, extensive offerings were made before the self-arisen Avalokiteśvara at Jagö Shong.

At the time of offering vast aspirational prayers, there were miraculous signs such as great showers of flowers. This was similar to how it is explained that when the Blessed One taught the profound Prajñāpāramitā sūtras, the gods made offerings with great māndārava flowers and such, and how flowers rained down when many holy beings like the glorious Sakya Paṇḍita and the accomplished scholar Yagpa held Dharma festivals. In that Female Water-Hare year, this great being was invited by Dharma King Dönyöd Dorje to Samdrub Tse, where he received many teachings including long-life empowerments and Mahākāla instructions, and he regarded him as the supreme among gurus. After that, he was again invited by the Bodongpas and stayed for one Dharma session at Jagö Shong. That summer, he was invited by Dagchen Namkha Dorje and his sons to Dzadong Tshang where he established two Dharma sessions. Through empowerments of Cakrasaṃvara, Yamāntaka, and others, as well as through instructions on the unelaborate path and so forth, he satisfied the disciples. Holy beings unanimously stated that during this time as well, great showers of flowers fell continuously. Then he gave Dharma teachings at Makhar, Thropu, and other places. After that, being invited by the abbot of Dechen, along with about a hundred monks who were earnest about the Precious Speech [gsung ngag], he turned the wheel of profound and vast Dharma teachings including the Precious Speech at Chum Dechen, causing countless disciples to mature and making the doctrine gentle and peaceful.

In the seventh month of the Horse year, he was invited by the great master and his sons to Jadong Tshang in the north, where he turned the wheel of Dharma for one month. At that time, there were over six hundred monks, and about three hundred volumes of philosophical texts were distributed. At the end of that year, he was invited by the Bodongpas and held a Dharma session at Ngönmo Dzong. In the first month of the Sheep year, at Thropur, he made extensive butter lamp offerings before the Venerable One and performed Dharma teachings and aspirational prayers as if in competition. That summer, he was again invited by the northern master to Jadong Tshang where he held a Dharma session. Then in the first month of the Monkey year, he conducted Dharma sessions and aspirational prayers at Thropur. After that, being invited by the Gyakhar people, he went to Jad Gangkhar for a Dharma session. That summer at Thubten Namgyal, the Lamdre gathering was so large that the assembly hall could not contain everyone, and they had to arrange seating in the courtyard. At that time, when it was said there would be a Dharma session at Sakya, someone asked Panchen Chöje, "Will fortunate disciples come here?" He replied, "This year we must definitely go to Sakya to make extensive butter lamp offerings before the Venerable Mañjuśrī, make aspirational prayers, and perform an extensive torma dedication before Mahākāla. " Thus, he went to Ngor for the autumn session. Then, returning to Thubten, he conducted the first winter Dharma session at Thropur, and with about five hundred monks, proceeded to the Great Seat on the tenth day. On the fourteenth day, the great festival day, tea was served to more than two thousand monastics, and each group of twelve monastics received one zho of gold as offering.

Butter lamps were kept burning continuously, with about five hundred measures of butter being offered. His residence was established in the living quarters of the Dharma King at the Mahayana temple of the Old Central Tower. The first Dharma session was conducted by the Lhachen group and the latter by the Lhasa group. The various ritual ceremonies, Dharma teachings, aspiration prayers, torma offerings, and other activities for the gathering of people and local patrons were similar to the intermediate Dharma sessions. In particular, for many great masters and dignitaries, including the crown jewel of all beings, the great lord Sönam Gyaltsen Palzangpo, he bestowed empowerments of Cakrasaṃvara Ḍākinī Ocean, Guhyasamāja, Mañjuśrī-Vajra and others, the reading transmission of the Ocean of Great Bliss empowerment water, the authorization of Iron-Sword Hayagrīva and others. For all gathered beings, he planted seeds of liberation through giving instructions on freedom from the four attachments and Tārā authorization, among others.

At those times, he said that the great venerable Sakyapa appeared in his dreams. He also said that these Dharma protectors were not satisfied merely with torma accomplishment practices and mantra recitations, but enjoyed melodic chants and feast offerings, which is how it is practiced now. All the people residing there firmly held as valid testimony that this holy lama was truly an emanation of the Venerable Precious Drakpa Gyaltsen. At that time, the faithful made countless offerings of bronze and cloth, which he dedicated to the outer and inner sacred objects of the Old Central Tower and to the periodic ritual ceremonies of the previous masters.

Having considered the auspicious connections for the flourishing of the Venerable Sakyapa's teachings, he also requested that a consecrated torma seal be placed before that very Se Gön. Thus, dedicating without exception even the slightest roots of virtue for the benefit of others, he acted in accordance with the conduct of the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra. This is indeed the authentic biography of the noble ones who have reached the grounds. As explained above, from the time he demonstrated taking birth in this realm for the sake of disciples, this account is presented according to both his ordinary activities and, in particular, the sequence of his noble deeds. Among these, combining in one place both the extraordinary life stories included therein and a few aspects of even more extraordinary life stories not included there, there are: 13 wondrous signs, 4 marks of accomplishment, and 6 exceptional deeds - these three categories. From these, regarding the first: When he was six or seven years old, while studying the text of Noble Conduct [Bhadracaryā], he observed the nature of conditioned existence, giving rise to bodhicitta in his mind-stream. At that time, he understood the meaning of the Dharma and the meaning of the scriptures became clear to him. He attained the signs of Mañjuśrī's approach through sūtra.

At the time of his activities, a sword with sheath appeared in his hand during a dream, and when he drew it from its sheath, it was a sign that it pervaded the three regions of Ü, Tsang, and Kham. This was a genuine sign of being blessed by Mañjuśrī. When examining the prophecies and signs with Gobo Rabjampa Sherab Pal, it was prophesied: "A scholar like me will come to you, and there will be great activities at a monastery facing east on the mountain behind," and it happened exactly as foretold. Having received the sacred blessings of the great Rongton, when he received the authorization of White Acala in his presence, the venerable Acala blessed him, saying "Acala has dissolved into this Khampa's torso. "

When he fell into the river after being cut off at Rongchung's narrow path, he called out to Sakya Paṇḍita, and Guru Mañjuśrī protected him in the water. He remained there reciting the Dharmarāja prayer twenty-four times, and when some monks easily rescued him, it was certain that he had received Sakya Paṇḍita's blessings. At the time of empowerment, Vajradhara entrusted him with the teachings. When Kunga Zangpo gave the empowerment, he blew the conch shell three times as the empowerment substance, and in accordance with the prophecy, he was proclaimed as the master of the teachings. The ḍākinīs bestowed siddhis upon him. The night before he was to receive the Kurukullā authorization, in his dream a woman wearing red brocade gave him a handful of fresh fruit and red powder as a sign, showing he was blessed by the ḍākinīs. Lingla cleared away obstacles.

When he was about to give teachings on the White Lineage's Commentary, one day he fell severely ill. That night, the Great Being appeared in his dream and gave him blessed water. When he awoke, his illness cleared like clouds dispersing. This appeared to benefit the teachings of the Great Being. When he requested permission to go to Kham in the presence of the Great One, he was told that staying in Ü-Tsang would bring greater benefit to beings.

When he was about to establish teaching sessions, through the blessings of the lama lineage and the Dharma protectors' commands, his body trembled and such. Through this, he was given one hundred nectar pills and was accepted by the lama. He averted obstacles to both the outer and inner Lamdre. While staying in that region, when he developed a serious illness, in Ngakchang Rinchen Namgyal's dream, someone claiming to be the king of Guge said that although Guge's wealth and power were in Ngor, in reality this had come because a most powerful holder of Ngor's teachings would come, and that he was creating obstacles. Based on the request that special prayers were needed for this, he practiced giving and taking bodhicitta and meditation on the inseparability of samsara and nirvana. In a dream, after the Great Being had completely bestowed the vase empowerment of Hevajra, at the point when he said "The bodily impurities are purified," he awoke and was freed from the illness.

At another time, he received a sign of benefit. In a dream, he saw a very large book written in gold, in which all the text consisted only of "Homage to Bhagavati Hevajra." This was a true sign of being accepted by the yidam deity, and appears to accord with the statement "Through reading and reciting sutras." When he was composing the General Commentary on the Three Vows, during a lunar eclipse one night in his dream, a white person placed a very large white conch shell in his lap. The sign that its cross-legged position filled the entire expanse was, like before, shown in many sutras and tantras to be a special sign. Again, when he saw good omens in dreams, he was guided by these. When he was composing the resolution of disputes regarding the Kunrik, in this master's dream-like vision, in a meadow there were many monks who had built a round Dharma throne. When asked whose it was, they said it was the throne from which the Lord Muchen taught the Purification Tantra. The master himself also assisted, and Muchen ascended the throne and taught the Purification Tantra.

He memorized just one page of notes from the teaching, most of which he wrote in the "Dispelling Harm for the Benefit of Others." At the end of that composition, he wrote: "Through finding profound meaning on the dream mountain peak, signs and marks shine brilliantly like sunlight."

Furthermore, when others saw and heard about these extraordinary life stories up to that point, it generated wonder, and unbiased intelligent beings developed faith. In the biography of this great being compiled by the incomparable Sönam Lhundrup, these were mentioned and he wrote: "These are the thirteen excellent, unmistaken, and wonderful signs."

The four signs of accomplishment:

Once again, he had a direct vision of the Dharma protectors. One night at Serling, when Chötrimpa came to make a request, it had become dark. [The protector] said "You came early. A beggar appeared who seemed to be a putra, carrying a conch. He was about to say something, but now he's gone." This was directly stated. Similarly, at times when no one was present with the master, there would be two or three echo-like responses to his speech that ordinary people couldn't understand. Some regular attendants like Zhönnu Zangpo and others also perceived this.

At Thubten, through a night vision, in what seemed to be the Kyedlha cave, he saw two Mon children who appeared to be attendants. He said they were likely emanations of Mahākāla [Dongzhipa]. The two Mon children nodded their heads and smiled. They were Jñānanātha, and through his clairvoyance, he said that at the end of his life he would focus solely on practice and teaching whatever pleased him. They replied "Practice, practice" while nodding and smiling - this was the sign he dreamed of.

When he was composing the commentary on the Seven Treaties [Saptadharmā], in a dream, he and Lama Lorinpa chanted the "Non-conceptual Praise" [Mi rtog ma] with melody.

Many melodies, light rays, and the appearance of numerous armies arose. When asked what they were, it was said they were the forces of glorious Mahākāla Caturmukha. When he looked, they appeared to be about three levels high up to his knee, and they said "We will be the guardians of this treatise."

In the dream of the Omniscient Namsöd, there was a great encampment at the base of the Black Horse Mountain. When asked what it was, he dreamed it was said to be the encampment of Gurugon of Sakya. He said "It is excellent that the Sakya teachings will spread here at Black Horse now," which was established as a common vision.

Thus, when slight signs of obstacles appeared in others' perceptions, by performing torma offerings, accomplishment rituals, and fulfillment practices for the Dharma protectors for just a few consecutive days, many holy beings unanimously stated that no obstacles could overwhelm him, as was directly evident.

When he gave teachings at Bodong Lhami's offering ceremony, and when he met the Lord (Jowo) at Jagöshong, flowers fell like snow, which everyone considered miraculous as a common vision.

When he gave the subsequent authorization for the Vajradhara Damchö Gandi and Guhyasamāja empowerments, he granted them after blowing the conch. When Gyaltsab Kunga Wangchuk prophesied that he needed to extend his gaze to philosophical views and monasteries, in accordance with this prophecy, when strongly requested by the Ngor tradition's officials, he sat upon the throne at Ewam and satisfied disciples by teaching countless profound and vast dharmas such as the precious Lamdre and others.

At that time, he requested the Venerable's empowerment transmission. Someone said, "You are creating auspicious connections for vast benefit to others," and gave him what was said to be blessed water from Venerable Drakpa. He dreamed this transformed into the dhāraṇī of Amitāyus.

In the dream of the wise Kunlo, this great being was seated on the throne at Ewam. In the space above, the precious Venerable said "This one will create methods for continuous benefit to others" and transformed into the form of Amitāyus. This vision accorded with the previous one. These four signs indicated that his mind-stream was completely matured and that he could guide others effortlessly - these were clearly within the domain of those noble ones who have attained the grounds [bhūmi].

Therefore, the incomparable Sönam Lhundrup stated:
"These four supreme signs of the lord of siddhas are:
1. Complete realization of the grounds and paths
2. Effortless benefit for beings"

Furthermore, regarding how he spread the Buddha's teachings through six extraordinary activities: This great being caused the teachings of the Sugata to flourish extensively through the three activities of teaching, debate and composition. As for how he caused the teachings to flourish through composing explanations of sutra and tantra and opening the lotus of scripture: Beyond the previously mentioned commonly known treatises on the Pāramitāyāna, the uncommon treatises on Vajrayāna, and works explaining the common meaning of both sutra and tantra, including responses to questions and collections of praises - these countless works delighted learned scholars who had trained extensively.

The compositions he authored delighted learned scholars who had trained extensively while humbling some who merely prided themselves as scholars. For most of his compositions, he received blessings from the guru and yidam deities, and the ḍākinīs and dharma protectors provided constant protection, either directly or through signs. These were extraordinary accomplishments. He refuted wrong views and misconceptions. When some engaged in many wrong practices motivated by mistaken views, he properly refuted them through authentic scriptural authority and reasoning. He composed many works like "Distinguishing Views" that demonstrated how to overwhelm opponents. Through direct debate, he overwhelmed many renowned scholars like the great scholar of Tsethang, which was unanimously acknowledged as an extraordinary accomplishment.

Furthermore, regarding benefiting beings and producing dharma holders: Based on teaching sūtra and tantra through the authentic treatises composed by the Buddha, the Six Ornaments, Two Supreme Ones and others, as well as his own valid explanatory commentaries on their intent, he produced countless dharma holders and filled most of the Land of Snows with the light of benefit and happiness - an extraordinary accomplishment.

Additionally, regarding viewing the guru with great love: When he needed to give empowerments to about a thousand people gathered, his body became slightly unwell due to the power of winter cold. After resting briefly due to physical exhaustion, during the night he had a vision where the venerable Great Sakya Paṇḍita appeared and said "Do not be negligent in benefiting beings."

Upon having this vision where the venerable Great Sakya Paṇḍita appeared and said "Do not be negligent in benefiting beings," he made refuge prayers with verses such as:

"Lord of all six realms, Vajradhara,
Gentle Voice who embodies all buddhas' wisdom,
Virūpa who holds all buddhas' power,
Inseparable guru, in you I take refuge."

Thus, through the power of this guru's exceptional inner samādhi, externally he had numerous pure visions through direct appearances, experiential visions, and signs of seeing many gurus, yidams, buddhas and bodhisattvas, and traveling to many buddha fields - an extraordinary accomplishment.

Furthermore, regarding making aspirational prayers for others' benefit: Thinking that the power of aspirational prayers would be especially potent at the special sites of the previous gurus who were like buddhas, he was invited by both the Great Lhakhang and Lhasa temples of the glorious great seat of Sakya. When he went there to teach dharma, he made extensive arrangements including offering tea and monetary distributions of 114 zho of gold to over two thousand monastics. Using the offerings he received, he established perpetual butter lamp offerings, renovations of temples, and regular ritual offerings to the previous venerable masters. He made countless pure aspirational prayers for the benefit and happiness of the doctrine and beings - activities that were like those of the bodhisattva Samantabhadra.

For future arrangements, he placed a consecrated torma offering and his seal at the feet of the emanated Mahākāla [bse mgon] at that special place. This was an exceptional deed done while contemplating the auspicious connections for the flourishing of the venerable Sakyapa's teachings.

These six activities were performed while thinking of benefiting the Buddha's doctrine and limitless sentient beings:

1. The three activities of teaching, debating, and composition
2. The three activities of hearing, contemplation, and meditation
3. Having visions of the guru who is inseparable from the buddhas who have gone to pure realms
4. Dedicating all his virtuous deeds for the benefit of others and arranging auspicious connections for the flourishing of the doctrine

These activities are beyond the scope of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas and are superior to them. Considering these, the holy being Sönam Lhundrup, who maintained an impartial mind, stated that these were the six exceptional deeds.

Thus, this great being's extraordinary liberation story contains:
1. Thirteen amazing signs according to categories
2. Four marks of accomplishment
3. Six exceptional deeds

These make twenty-three when counted together. It should be understood that within these are contained some additional liberation stories and countless extraordinary liberation stories indicated by these. Others should be sought elsewhere.

Thus, since this great being possessed the special inner qualities of the two types of precious bodhicitta through which he cared for all beings...

During the same period, there were countless spiritual friends, great lords of earth who protected the dharma and ruled over realms, countless disciples of sharp intellect who sought meaning, and even ordinary beings who possessed just a small root of virtue in accordance with merit. Let alone receiving dharma connections from this holy being, merely seeing his form, hearing even a few words about his qualities, or simply remembering his name generated great accumulations of merit through devoted faith, inspired wonder, gave rise to meaningful thoughts, and caused bodily hairs to bristle - in these and many other ways, they took refuge in and made offerings to him exclusively. Those unfortunate beings whose intelligence was damaged by evil spirits of wrong views and who fell under the influence of negative friends, lacking guides to see the authentic meaning, were like waterbugs grasping at illusions. Furthermore, during the dharma festival at Sakya, after completing the empowerments, someone overheard him saying privately, "That is not the empowerment's aftermath. " Then, in his sixty-first year, on the eighth day of the first month of the Earth-Female-Bird year, he concluded the dharma festival at the Great Seat. The next day, he made butter lamp offerings and extensive aspirational prayers at Zadrak Cave. Then, due to Bodongpa's extremely persistent requests, he established dharma teachings at Ngönmo Dzong. On the eighteenth day, during the dharma session, it seems there were various gatherings that were like symbolic expressions, and they said these would be presented at the main seat.

At the gathering, when he said things like "He will not come" and many other statements that some understood and some did not, everyone present became doubtful. That afternoon, when several officials from Senge Tse made many tea offerings, this became a condition that led to showing slight signs of illness related to his body's shadow. The next day, though his attendants who were present made extensive ritual offerings including tea services with complete sets of robes and other offering materials, considering that the karmic fortune of disciples in this realm was temporarily limited to that much, and making aspirational prayers for Sukhāvatī again and again, he seemed to be creating the momentum to depart for Sukhāvatī. At dawn on the twenty-first, he asked "Is it the twenty-first today?" When those present confirmed it was, he said "It seems like me and regent Kunga Wangchuk. Though we need to reach Thubten Namgyal, it is to observe the guru's anniversary," and entered into the time of spiritual practice.

Having completed the meditation and recitation of the generation and completion stages of Hevajra, at the conclusion, he gradually dissolved the mandala of self-generation. Without interruption from others, in that very moment he rested in equipoise in the profound approaching death, and dissolved his form into the dharmadhātu. 

Supreme guru and teacher, you dwell in the dharmadhātu,
When the sun of your teachings nears the western mountain,
Because you, holder of the doctrine, have abandoned this realm,
Who else could have doubts about the doctrine?
However, after ripening fortunate disciples...

At dawn on the twenty-first, after ripening fortunate disciples and returning to rest in the dharmakāya - since this is the way of all holy beings, what reason do we have for grief and abandonment? Though you possess the power to remain for countless eons and perfectly understand the sun-like Buddha's doctrine, when you depart this realm for the dharmakāya, will you, with your excellent wisdom, abandon us out of compassion? However, from attaining mastery of the ten bhūmis to becoming a source of wisdom regarding profound meaning, because you manifested through your great compassionate power, I especially recall your immeasurable kindness.

Then after two days passed, the holy remains were transported. At dawn on the twenty-fourth, they arrived at Thubten Namgyal and arrangements were immediately made for cremation. However, due to manifestations of the dharma protectors' displeasure, including an unprecedented great windstorm and other signs, they were unable to cremate immediately. Therefore, they temporarily enshrined the remains in the form of a stupa amid vast clouds of offerings. The next day, there were continuous extraordinary signs including a completely clear sky and a dome of rainbows. At the stupa, several vajra holders including the reincarnation of Chöje Zhönnu Gyalchok performed uninterrupted Hevajra sādhana offerings until the cremation. Starting from the day after the remains arrived, for two months,

During each day, there were two community tea services and two midday meals for accomplishing the enlightened intention. During breaks, there was much effort put into stone-stacking for the sacred reliquary chamber and laying foundations [rmongs 'ding], and excellent provisions of barley and other goods were distributed to all monastics and laypeople. Then, since Kong-tön Wangchuk Drubpa needed to travel to Central Tibet for a Dharma-related activity, he came to Thubten and gave counsel. They invited Master Könchok Pel. Five Nepalese artisan craftsmen and their students also arrived and began preparations to construct a thirteen-cubit-high golden statue of the Great Sage [Buddha] as the inner support. At dawn on the twenty-first day of the eighth lunar month, Master Könchok Pel performed the cremation according to the procedures taught in the tantras. The fire's color was white, there were auspicious signs such as beautiful shapes in the vase and conch, pleasing sounds, wafting fragrant aromas, the sky being filled with rainbow light, and a rain of divine flowers - events that became objects of faith for people. When they opened the cremation chamber on the new moon day, the skull had remained whole. It appears there were also countless relics from the holy remains and cremation ash. The whole skull was installed in the heart center of the inner support. One portion of the remains was purified here, and following Panchen Chöje's procedures, about seven hundred large tsatsas were made containing the essence of the four great dhāraṇīs, colored according to the five Buddha families, and installed with robes from the navel down. One portion of the bone relics was made into tsatsas containing dhāraṇī essences and later installed inside the outer support.

The remaining remains were cast into a statue of Mañjuśrī, gilded, and consecrated, and were offered as objects of faith to all faithful ones throughout the Snowy Land, appearing to spread even until today. Then Master Könchok Pelwa performed the procedures and arranged the inner support's dhāraṇīs in their proper order. Panchen Wangchuk Drubpa and Chöje Nyentsabpa and others, serving as attendants to Master Könchok Pelwa for a while, performed elaborate Hevajra sādhana offerings and consecration ceremonies. At that time, flowers for long-life prayers were scattered, and simultaneously the sun shone through the eastern window of the pure chamber onto the heart of the support, creating extremely auspicious connections. That morning, there was an extensive distribution of community tea and offerings from the labrang, and extensive donations were made by the people. At midday, Nangpa Rinchen Tsewe offered excellent community tea and gifts. All teachers and students pervasively made extensive verses of auspiciousness and well-wishes in unison. Led by the divine craftsmen, all the artisans were given clothing, provisions, and farewell gifts most excellently, making them happy, pleased and delighted. Thus, Master Könchok Pelwa, from the time of accomplishing the enlightened intention of this great being until the consecration of the inner support, stayed at Thubten Namgyal, showing tremendous kindness to Epa, and then appears to have departed for the sacred ground of Ewam Chöden.

The account of the unceasing enlightened activities is as follows: Among the many who were worthy to be successors of this great being, during the time of teaching Dharma at Ngönmo Dzong, just as this great being had prophesied by speaking many signs in the language of ordinary people, on the fourteenth day of the sixth Hor month of the Iron Male Dog year, Lord Döndrup Dorje, with excellent arrangements and organization, requested the supreme heart-son of that master himself - the great paṇḍita learned in the five sciences, Wangchuk Drubpa Gyaltsen Pelzangpo, the Holy Lion of Dharma, who was accomplished in the two stages and master of the ocean of sūtra and tantra - to ascend the throne. Making many auspicious verses of gods and humans and showering a rain of flower petals, they enthroned him as the great successor.

That master himself then took up the great responsibility for the teachings. Initially, in the Pig year, during the Miracle Month, Nangpa Rinchen Tsewe established regular monthly offerings of community tea and provisions, annual offerings of sixty khal of butter for lamp offerings before the inner supports, and with Panchen Rinpoche presiding, made offerings of complete sets of food and drink all at once, while all people made prostrations and whatever offerings they could, circumambulating the temple and so forth. Simultaneously, from the north, the lord and disciples also made many butter lamp offerings and established regional divisions.

The supreme regent Panchen Chöje, primarily emphasizing the piṭakas, gave excellent teachings on sūtra and tantra based on the excellent legacy of the Omniscient One's words, in accordance with the disciples' minds. Through this, the monastic assembly greatly expanded, intellectual development increased tremendously, and most minds turned toward Dharma. It appears that very many spiritual friends capable of working for the doctrine also emerged.

Not only did the teachings flourish at this place alone, but throughout the Snowy Land, direct and indirect disciples of the Great Omniscient One who were learned and disciplined pervaded and worked for the doctrine. To briefly mention just a rough outline of these activities:

Among those born into the pure lineage of the Khön clan:
1. First, Lord Sönam Gyaltsen Pelzangpo, who initially held the throne of the Fourth Floor at Sakya and later became the protector of beings at the border of Tibet and China
2. Chöje Gönpo Wangchuk and others who spread the teachings in glorious Sakya
3. The holy teacher Könchok Pel at the second great seat of Ewam Chöden
4. Jamyang Sangye Rinchen, who turned the wheel of Dharma in many regions including glorious Nālanda
5. Chöje Gyalwa Özer, holder of the upper monastery seat at Tibet's Vajrāsana Sangne'u Thog

At the lower monastery [gling smad], Master Chöje Kunga Peljor; in eastern Tibet [mdo khams], Chöje Kunga Dawa who spread the teaching and study of sūtra and tantra; at Gazi, Shakya Lowa and his disciples; at Kyomda, Abbot Rabjampa Lhawang Lodrö; at Nyagra, Serdokpa Gedün Senge; at Bom, his younger brother Lekpa Gyaltsen; at Drakde'u, Abbot Wönpo Jamyang Pel; Kachupa Lodrö Gyaltsen and others; at Khangmo Che, Kachupa Tsultrim Özer and others; Rongpo Jozang; at Denma, Kachupa Sherab Senge; at Kangyul, Rabjampa Sönam Tenzin who maintained the teaching and study; at Chökhor Drung monastery seat, Chöje Sherab Rinchen, the reincarnation of Panchen Sherab Rinchen; at Chum Dechen, Abbot Chöje Namkha Pelkyong; at Taklung Nakar, Abbot Chöje Drakpa Yeshe; at Pelkhor Dechen, Acting Abbot Chöje Gedün Pelwa; at Dritsam, Jatang Chöje Kunga Chokden; at the great monastic college [grwa tshang chen mo], Abbot Chöje Chökyong Gyaltsen; Muchen Rabjampa Thukje Pelzang who established Thubten Yangpachen Monastery and spread enlightened activities; and at Ngamring, led by Abbot Jangsempa, many senior spiritual friends of the Sakyapa of that time became disciples of this great master. At Mu, there was Chöje Nyentsab Tsultrim Zangpo; at Ngari, Tengchen Abbot Könchok Kyab; at Jatsang, Abbot Rabjampa Gönpo Zangpo; at Guge Zhide, Chöje and others - those whose names are mentioned here are just a rough outline of those who held positions as abbots of great monasteries and high positions.

Through the suffix "and so forth" are indicated those who maintain the teaching and study in the various colleges of the great religious centers. Throughout the various regions of the Land of Snows (Tibet), they gathered circles of bright students and independently maintained teaching and study. Through giving empowerments, tantra explanations, and oral instructions to fortunate disciples in various monasteries and hermitages while emphasizing the concentrations of the two stages, there were countless disciples like Shedrong Panchen and Khepa Drakkunpa. Their making this Land of Snows into a fortunate realm is not mere speculation about hidden matters but is clearly established through direct observation, which is the excellent activity of uninterrupted enlightened deeds.

From the ocean of the omniscient master's biography:
"Having well gathered just a portion with the light of faith,
To satisfy my mind and to increase the stream of faith
For other fortunate ones through the power of giving,
May all beings who have faith and respect
For supreme holy beings like yourself
Abandon all adverse conditions and gather perfect favorable conditions
And attain the bliss of liberation equal to yours.
Especially may all your disciples who pray
Abandon all adverse conditions in this very life
And may their desired aims be fulfilled as wished
And swiftly attain buddhahood for beings' benefit.
Moreover, although in this life I lack the fortune
To directly see your form, nevertheless
Having received prophecy through dream visions,
I pray to cut all nets of doubt."

May all obstacles be dispelled and all necessary conditions be gathered spontaneously for accomplishing your vast enlightened activities, including non-harmful dwellings, virtuous food, and all desired necessities.

In all lifetimes, may you, protector, care for me, and through the four empowerments that ripen, may you bless my mindstream so that the profound path of the two stages increases more and more.

In brief, what more need be said? I pray for blessings to become inseparable from you, perfect venerable guru, in qualities of abandonment, realization and enlightened activities.

Whatever virtue was thus created and all other merit accumulated throughout the three times, I dedicate in common with all beings equal to space to attain the state of Buddha Śākyasiṁha.

For whoever develops deep certainty without doubt about this approach, that supreme guide, the holy guru, will definitely care for them with a delighted mind.

Thus for the crown jewel of beings including gods, the great lamp that generates the light of primordial wisdom even for beings blinded by ignorance in these degenerate times, the one who establishes suitable disciples on the path of ripening and liberation, who possesses clear dharma vision regarding all spheres of knowledge, an ocean that contains all the waters of sūtra and tantra without exception - this biography called "Increasing the River of Faith" of the omniscient lord of scholars known as Sönam Senge was composed by the one called Tsuktor Kachupa, who appears to have excellent analytical understanding of all scriptures and has perfected the sciences of grammar, poetry and so forth.

Although there are many biographical accounts of the great omniscient one composed by various authors, due to the separate transmission lineages, they have become rare nowadays. Within this biography composed by Panchen Rinpoche, these matters were written based on direct hearing or through reliable transmission. Though it is said there are many other wonderful biographical accounts that were heard but not written here, this biography was compiled based on the words of holy beings who do not speak falsely and maintaining the oral transmission lineages, and in order not to disobey the instruction that one must maintain the oral transmission lineages. Based on the oral traditions of many holy beings who long attended this great being's lotus feet, and also based on the biographies compiled by Zhönnu Zangpo who long attended this great being's person, as confirmed by other holy and qualified beings worthy of trust, this was respectfully composed by the one called Bhikshu Jampa Rabten on the twenty-first day of the seventh Hor month of the female earth-hare year at Thubten Namgyal monastery. The scribe was Drakpa Tashi.

Through this may the precious teachings of the Buddha, source of benefit and happiness, spread and flourish. May all beings have happiness and well-being. May all mother sentient beings swiftly attain the supreme siddhi of Mahāmudrā.

The Biography of the Omniscient Dharma King Sönam Senge Called "The Sun Illuminating Wonders that Increases Merit" is complete.
Ngawang Kunga Sönam.

In Sanskrit: Sarvajñā Guru Dharmārāja Punya Siṃha Pādaya Mama Bhūmi Paṇḍuka Vakra Gandri Puṇya Namaḥ

In Tibetan: I, Sakya Ngawang Kunga Sönam, prostrate to the feet of the Omniscient Guru, Dharma King Sönam Senge.

I take refuge with great devotion until enlightenment in:
1. The unsurpassed Master, Son of the Śākyas, possessor of the ten powers
2. The holy Dharma, which is the essence of his taught scripture and realization 
3. The bodhisattva upholders of the teachings and the ordinary sangha

I bow a hundred times contemplating the wondrous biographies of the powerful scholars and siddhas who illuminated the Buddha's teachings through explanation and practice in the Noble Land.

I prostrate, having been born with knowledge of kindness and gratitude, to the kindness of the Sakyapas - crown ornament of all who illuminate the flow of teachings in this land of snows - along with their father-son lineage.

I honor with my crown the dust of the feet of the Omniscient One from Dokham, Sönam Senge, who perfectly illuminated the complete body of teachings of sutra and tantra according to the tradition established by such great beings.

This supreme sun illuminating all the collections of wondrous biographies - the collections of deeds of the supreme sons born from the Dharma of that holy one - I publish this supreme work to increase merit.

Here, for the sake of sheltering from all the sufferings of this difficult age of strife in the northern lineage, the wisdom manifestation of all the Victorious Ones, Lord Mañjughoṣa himself...

The great Sakyapa named Drakpa Gyaltsen, who wore white cotton robes, established as many beings as there are particles in the earth on the path of liberation and freedom. Then, taking intentional rebirth in the land of Kham Bom in order to further spread his own teachings, this lord of the three realms illuminated the Buddha's teachings ever more brilliantly through limitless wonderful deeds. Through the light rays of explanation, debate and composition, he completely dispelled the thick darkness of mind for countless beings who were like blind people totally confused about what to adopt and reject. Having generated the difficult-to-fathom illumination of wisdom arising from hearing, contemplation and meditation, he was like a sun of eloquence causing the hundred petals of explanation and practice to bloom in all directions. The great accomplished master Padmakara prophesied that he would serve the teachings in Jambudvīpa. He was like a regent of the Buddha in the Land of Snows. He was a great charioteer who, having thoroughly refuted all wrong views and tenets regarding the Buddha's teachings through scripture and reasoning, established anew the tradition of the authentic path. He was the foremost son of all the Victorious Ones who received fresh nectar of ripening and liberation directly from the faces of his many direct and indirect teachers and countless meditation deities who displayed their faces and blessed him. He was a lord of power whom the protectors of the teachings - the ocean, gods, rākṣasas and haughty spirits - obeyed according to his commands.

The omniscient lord of scholars, the Victorious One Sönam Senge, also known as Gorampa Tenpa'i Nyima, having traversed the vast path of the two accumulations for many previous eons, attained simultaneously both the dharmakāya of indivisible basic space and primordial wisdom, and the rūpakāya possessing the five certainties many eons ago, equal to the number of sand grains in the Ganges River. Again, through limitless magical displays of whatever was needed to tame beings, he manifested simultaneously throughout all world systems. Thus, in some pure world systems he appeared as the sambhogakāya, in some as the nirmāṇakāya, and in many impure world systems he manifested as Brahma, Indra, universal monarchs, minor kings, the sun, the moon, wish-fulfilling jewels, wish-granting trees and so forth, fulfilling the hopes of beings according to their wishes. Therefore, even if all his qualities were to be described by the Victorious Ones and their heirs for an eon or more than an eon, they could not reach their limit - how could childish ordinary beings like us, whose eyes of intelligence are blinded by the thick darkness of ignorance, possibly see them?

Nevertheless, [this biography] relies on the accounts written by holy ones who remain impartial - having long ago abandoned all faults such as deliberately speaking falsely - and who, as direct and indirect disciples holding the secrets of this holy one's speech, possess wisdom eyes as vast as space regarding all mandalas of knowledge. Based on this, I will write a brief account of how [he] appeared as a great spiritual friend to ordinary beings after taking birth as a human like ourselves. The main biographical accounts of this holy one include those composed by:
1. The great Kong-tön Wangchuk Drubpa, his regent and master of the five sciences
2. The great being Muchen Sangye Rinchen
3. The ascetic Tingkyepa Ripa Kunga Chokden
4. The abbot of Gadong, Rinchen Palzang
5. The omniscient abbot of Lowo, Lekpai Jungne
6. The lord of scholars, Radön Yönten Jungne, who composed both root text and commentary
7. His scribe Awo Zhönnu Zangpo
8. Boldrongpa Rigpai Wangchuk
9. Later, the lord of scholars, Khenchen Jampa Rabten

Though it is said there exists one composed by Puru Chöje Jangchub Gyaltsen, I have not personally seen it. I have well compiled the wonderful aspects from these, corrected those with slight chronological confusion, thoroughly investigated the sources of any contradictions, and also incorporated the amazing stories and qualities that appear in the biographies of many accomplished scholars who served at this holy one's feet.

The text has five topics regarding how to properly describe the qualities, avoiding fabrication and exaggeration:

1. How he entered the gateway of the precious teachings and underwent training from youth after taking birth in a special family lineage
2. How he traveled to Ü and Tsang relying on excellent spiritual guides and received teachings on sutra and tantra from holy ones
3. How he established new teaching centers after completing his training and conducted teaching and learning primarily focused on the pitakas
4. How he was empowered as regent of the Buddha and conducted teaching and learning primarily focused on tantras
5. How he trained accomplished scholar disciples through unceasing virtuous activities

Regarding the first topic: Among the three great regions - Upper Ngari Korsum, Central Ü-Tsang Ruzhi, and Lower Do-Kham Gangsum - which belonged to the subjects of the divine kings known as the Three Ancestral Religious Kings of the Land of Snows, this holy one's birthplace was in a place called Bom, a branch of what is known as Markham Gang within Do-Kham Gangsum. In its upper reaches, it was completely endowed with rivers and water resources. Being free from harm by humans and non-humans, it was filled with quadrupeds throughout all mountains and valleys. It was inhabited by many wealthy people who freely enjoyed the resources and nutrients. In its lower reaches, there were hundreds of thousands of prosperous towns filled with happiness and wellbeing like the city of Indra descended to earth, and fields completely filled with various grains ripening in season.

The land was beautified with myriad flowers and fruits, adorned in all directions by rows of magnificent trees. Countless merchants and people of various regions gathered there. Its prosperity rivaled that of Vaiśravaṇa's glory. The people, being of great valor and might, subdued enemy forces. Regarding virtuous matters, they were like natural white swans, holding in highest regard and paying homage to the Buddha's teachings and its holders. In particular, there was Bom, established by the Chinese princess Kong-jo for Tibet's benefit and welfare.

Near the place called Dokham Ngang-nang, where the lord of scholars Gyatön Kunga Tsöndrü long bestowed the ripening and liberating rain-shower of vajrayāna teachings, in the upper valley of Gobo known as Bom Lungda, which was considered an object of aspiration for all discerning beings like the sun and moon, he was born to a father from the special lineage of the glorious Gobo clan named Rutsa Zhangkyab, who was wealthy and generous in virtuous matters, had memorized many minor sutras and numerous religious practices, and possessed stable family lineage power, and to a mother named Gyalwa Men, who was free from all deceit and possessed all praiseworthy feminine qualities. He was born on an auspicious date during the star of Revati in the eighth month of the Earth-Female-Bird year, while the mother was in comfort.

When he was born in his home, there were auspicious signs such as the appearance of the sun and moon. He was given the name Minyak Pal. This lord had an elder half-brother named Yeshe Gyaltsen. Among his four siblings sharing the same father and mother, he was the second eldest. His elder brother, called Lhazowa Tsöndrü Bum, was skilled in the arts and crafts. His two younger brothers were Taklekpa Gyaltsen, who became ordained, and Namdru, who took charge of worldly affairs. The younger brother Lekpa Gyaltsen went to Ü-Tsang, met with this lord himself, and received a treasury of profound and vast teachings including empowerments, transmissions, and instructions. He then returned to Dokham where, it is said, he greatly benefited the doctrine and beings.

Among them, this lord, from the moment of birth, possessed hundreds of marks of merit such as having an umbrella-like crown, a broad forehead, high nose, and a lion-like expanded upper body with proportionate form. He was fair-skinned with radiant light, his faculties were clear and pleasing like nectar for everyone's eyes, and transcending ordinary childish behavior, even his play took the form of building stupas and giving and receiving teachings, showing the awakening of positive habitual tendencies from the past. When he reached five or six years of age, he learned reading and writing, becoming knowledgeable just by being shown the symbols. At that time, he composed praises on the six perfections and poetics for his reading teacher.

When that teacher could not comprehend this holy one's natural disposition, he remarked "Your poetry came earlier." At that time, while reading the Bhadracaryāpraṇidhāna as an example, upon seeing passages such as "When I come to the time of death," he directly realized the impermanence of all conditioned things being destroyed in an instant. Great renunciation and weariness arose, causing tears to fall repeatedly.

That day, just as reflections appear in a clear mirror, a realization arose where the meaning of the scriptures became extremely clear in the mirror of his mind. From then on, he developed genuine perception of disenchantment with all the perfections of existence, like a sick person viewing food, and genuine, uncontrived thoughts of renunciation from samsara. When he requested his parents' permission to enter the door of the Dharma, they gladly agreed.

At eight years of age, in the male Fire Dragon year, before the direct disciple of the Omniscient One of Rong, the holy upholder of vows, the son of the Victor Künga Bum, he received the complete upāsaka vows. When he began his studies, whether in memorizing compilations or mastering texts, his vast intelligence in all subjects was beyond others' comprehension, amazing everyone. People remarked that "This young monk will certainly become a great scholar [rab 'byams smra ba]," and thus the title "Rabjam" naturally stuck to him from that time, as mentioned in the biographical accounts.

Once, while sitting near his father who was reciting the aspiration prayers of the Bhadracaryā, [he heard] "May I go to that pure realm of Sukhāvatī."

Upon hearing these verses, he instantly became concerned that his father might not remain [in this world] much longer and might depart for Sukhāvatī right away, causing tears to fall. When his father asked the reason, he replied that it was because great compassion had moved his mind, causing him to make repeated aspirations to be born in that pure realm.

Just as if triggered by hearing those words, he beheld the entire expanse of space filled with magnificent and captivating pure land arrangements appearing in a shimmering display, and he remained absorbed in that state for a long time.

At age ten, in the male Earth Horse year, he received both his novice ordination and śrāmaṇera vows from the direct disciple of the Great Master of Rong, the great Vinaya holder Sönam Özer, and Master Künga Bum. Having obtained the foundation of the teachings, the prātimokṣa vows, he was given the name Sönam Senge. He also received the śrāmaṇera precepts from both these preceptors.

Although previous biographies show many inconsistencies, when carefully examined, this account is undoubtedly correct. Among Master Künga Bum's many monk students who were purely dedicated to their studies, although this holy one was the youngest, his diligence exceeded all others. He would practice recitation from midnight until dawn, causing the elder monks to complain that his excessive diligence disturbed their sleep and got them scolded by the master. They would often beat and harass him. Then, before the master could request it, he completed his recitation practice of the Madhyamakāvatāra without vocal recitation. Afterward, he practiced recitation together with the others.

Then from Kachen Yinpa Zangpo, who was a direct disciple of Rongton Smra ba'i Senge and had completed the ten scriptural trainings, [he studied] the Fifty Verses on the Guru.

The Fifty Verses with Kamalaśīla's commentary, and the Vinayasūtra with its three hundred verses along with the self-commentary Prabhāvatī - having thoroughly learned the meaning of these root texts, he gained fearless confidence in the Vinaya Piṭaka and maintained extremely pure conduct, untainted by even the subtlest stains of downfalls. In his eleventh year, the female Earth Sheep year, he met Gobo Rabjampa Sherab Palwa, one of the famous four great disciples of Yangtshar, who was a direct disciple of the Omniscient One of Rong. Seeing special signs that indicated he would greatly benefit the teachings, [Sherab Palwa] said "Stay here for a while and study. "

When he gave teachings on Rongton's Clear Elucidation Commentary on the Prajñāpāramitā, [Sönam Senge] absorbed its meaning completely. Delighted, [Sherab Palwa] said "Someone just like me has come. " Everyone called him "Gobo Rabjampa," which led to the terms "Greater and Lesser Gorampa" becoming well-known. Under this holy master, he received the Madhyamaka bodhicitta generation, Sakya Paṇḍita's Great Bodhicitta Generation, the Bodhicaryāvatāra, Śāntideva's commentary on the Twenty Verses on the Vows, and teachings on the chapters on ethical discipline from the Bodhisattvabhūmi. He studied many authoritative texts including the Four Great Treatises and the Root Text and Introduction to the Middle Way, thoroughly comprehending their meaning and properly maintaining the conduct of a great bodhisattva. At that time, having requested and practiced the blessing empowerment of Mañjuśrī Arapacana, in a dream he found a sword with its scabbard. When he drew it from the scabbard, it appeared as an endless blue-green [blade].

Due to his karmic propensities of wishing to travel to Central Tibet and Tsang, he dreamed that this sword also seemed to reach Central Tibet and Tsang. When the entire sword emerged, it filled all the regions of Central Tibet and Tsang. At its tip hung two orbs representing the sun and moon, and its dark blade split open with both sides extremely bright. When he drew it back, it returned to its scabbard. Just as it touched his teeth, he awoke. Regarding this, it was said that the sword represented limitless wisdom; the sun and moon hanging at its tip indicated great renown and enlightened activities in both sutra and tantra; the two bright sides indicated that in the first half of his life he would engage in intense study and in the latter half accomplish great enlightened activities; and the split blade indicated various obstacles such as illness in the middle of his life. When he reported this dream and its manifestations to the Great Gorampa, [the latter] said, "This corresponds to the special signs that appeared to me when you came here. It is a sign that inconceivable enlightened activities will emerge." [He continued,] "I also went to Central Tibet and Tsang. I studied many profound and vast teachings from many holy beings including the lord of scholars Yagdrong and others, cutting through doubts. At the great monastic seat of Tsethang, I performed many activities to benefit the teachings such as teaching sessions on around one hundred volumes." He gave excellent advice saying "You too should go to Central Tibet and Tsang and do likewise," and showed great delight.

In his thirteenth year, the female Iron Bird year of "Evil Mind," [he met] the Omniscient Rongton and...

Due to being a heart-son of the Victor Künzang from his time as a regular monk, he received the preparatory part of the Hevajra empowerment in the oral tradition from Wapa Chöje Martön Gyaltsen Özer, who became a guru to the great rulers of Central Tibet including Wang Drakpa Jungne. On the evening of the preparation, in a dream, a person who claimed to be sent by Lama Künga Zangpo, with yellowish facial hair, gave him a drum to play. When he played it, its sound seemed to fill all three realms of existence. [The person] said "Take care of this" and gave him a handful of fresh fruit. This was certainly an omen that his fame would pervade the three realms and that he would become a master of teachings such as Hevajra.

Then at Rasa Dor, from Rinchen Lodrö - the lord of scholars and holder of the ten scholarly subjects, who was one of the twelve disciples who properly maintained the oral teachings of the Omniscient Rongton - he received teachings on the Prajñāpāramitā texts, empowerments of the Eighty Mahāsiddhas, blessing empowerment of orange Mañjuśrī, oral transmission of Vajrāsana's Praise, and others. In brief, before traveling to Central Tibet and Tsang, under both the Great Gorampa and Master Künga Bum, he studied and mastered the twelve major texts: the four major subjects [ka chen bzhi], the latter four Maitreya texts [byams chos phyi ma bzhi], the Abhidharmakośa, and both collections of the three Madhyamaka texts - the Root, Introduction and Compendium [ma rtsa 'jug bzhi gsum sdom rigs gnyis]. He also studied and mastered Yak's Great Commentary up through the three knowledges, the complete Rong Commentary, and works by the Lord of Reasoning Gewa Gyaltsen including the Collected Topics on Direct Contradiction and Circular Reasoning and the Wheel of the Sun.

Not only did he study the Bodhicaryāvatāra and many other scriptures, but even his knowledge of scriptural terminology and pronunciation was no less proficient than that of the later excellent masters.

2. Regarding how he was strongly inspired by extraordinary aspirations and traveled to Central Tibet and Tsang, and how he pursued his studies after arriving there, there are two parts:

2.1 First, when he reached nineteen years of age, in the female fire-hare year, through the force of awakening excellent latent predispositions, he thought thus: "If I remain long in this native land of mine, which is like an island in a poisonous ocean or a demon's prison filled with numerous faults such as attachment, aversion, and ignorance, the threefold practice of hearing, contemplation, and meditation in the footsteps of the Buddha and his heirs will become corrupted. I might be carried away by the distractions of sensual pleasures or, due to others' influence, might engage in meaningless activities under the control of guardians. The holy ones of the past also abandoned attachment to their homelands and, by relying on seats of learning, achieved immeasurable temporary and ultimate benefit. In these regions of Central Tibet and Tsang, the succession of emanated Dharma kings, including the three ancestral kings and their descendants, established the tradition of Buddha's teachings. Numerous Indian paṇḍitas and siddhas like Śāntarakṣita and Padmasambhava, and many masters of both languages who became the eyes of the world, such as the three great translators of Ngok, Chak and Zhang, translated countless sūtras, śāstras, and oral instructions, thereby causing the Buddha's teachings to spread and flourish."

"Even now, there exists a place resembling a pure land where the melodious sounds of teaching and learning continue uninterruptedly. Having gone there, I shall thoroughly train in all spheres of knowledge and, through the three activities of scholars, cause the precious general and specific teachings to flourish like a hundred-petaled lotus in the mandala of the sun." Being irresistibly drawn by the renowned fame of masters such as Rongton Sheja Kunrik and Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo, a strong aspiration to travel to Central Tibet and Tsang arose in his mind. When he submitted this request to the great monastery of Goram, [they replied], "That is excellent. We too should send some offerings to present before the All-knowing Lord, and we must also mention sending a group of students. We will go as far as Riwo Che. The students from here should also prepare to go together." He was very pleased with this response.

Thus, at age twenty, in the male earth-dragon year, he properly set out for Central Tibet and Tsang with excellent provisions. At that time, since the activities of Lord Rabjampa were very extensive, he was invited to a vast jeweled throne at Taklung Martang, which was known as Riwo Che, as the support for the Taklung lineage. There he turned the great wheel of Dharma and accomplished vast benefit for others. At that time, about sixty people who came to study in Central Tibet and Tsang became like equal sons of the same father. Due to some minor difficulties in composing the heading of a petition letter requesting a hundred offerings to be presented to Lord Rongton...

Relying on some minor challenges, Lord Rabjampa said, "Tomorrow when I go to teach Dharma, whoever among you monks arrives at the throne together with him will be appointed as the head scribe." Having made this skillful arrangement, they dispersed. That night, in this master's dream, there appeared many high and majestic white thrones facing south before a mountain. When he asked a companion whose thrones these were, he dreamed the reply, "These are your teaching thrones." The next day, he followed precisely in Lord Rabjampa's footsteps as he went to teach. In the middle of the great gathering, he caught hold of the third layer of Lord's robes and, not letting go, arrived at the throne together with the Lord. When he reported how the dream had occurred, [the Lord] was very pleased and prophesied, saying "You will accomplish inconceivable enlightened activities in front of mountains facing south and east."

Then Lord Rabjampa composed such a petition letter to Rongton Omniscient Sheja Kunrik: "To the feet of the Second Teacher, the Third Supreme One, the Fourth Buddha, the Fifth Gatekeeper, the Sixth Place, the Seventh Ornament, the Dharma King, the Omniscient One," and so forth with many excellent and pleasing prefatory expressions. Regarding the items to be offered: one hundred and one monks including those from Goram, one hundred and one packages of Chinese tea including those from Hamkhrung, one hundred and one male yaks including those from Gyingkar, and so forth.

Having composed a petition letter filled with many praises and accolades for this lord, he sent it as an offering to the great monastery known as Nālandā or "Lord of Continuity." There, at the feet of the great Indian master Kamalaśīla (in Tibetan, Padma'i ngang tshul) and others like the noble Indian ones, countless fortunate beings were established on the path of ripening and liberation. Later, intentionally taking rebirth in Eastern Gyamorong and appearing in the form of a completely perfect great paṇḍita, the Omniscient Rongton benefited beings. Having arrived safely without obstacles during the summer retreat period at his feet, [Sönam Senge] became extremely delighted.

He also visited Samye, Sangphu, and Lhasa, where he performed the Seven-Branch Prayer and extensive aspirational prayers. At that time, he saw Rongton Smra ba'i Senge (Lion of Speech) sitting resplendently amidst an ocean-like assembly, turning the wheel of Dharma. Upon seeing and hearing this, his joy and faith increased greatly, causing his hair to stand on end. Thinking that all those gathered there were solely scholars learned in scripture and reasoning, he felt reverence and slight hesitation. When he first joined the group studying the abbreviated texts on logic and reasoning, his intelligence shone like a star before the sun among those bright young students. Then he joined the group studying minor texts, and it was just the same as before. Then he joined those studying intermediate texts. During that summer teaching session, he engaged in extensive discussions with the highly intelligent students of intermediate texts.

He heard all the teachings on the Prajñāpāramitā Rongtika and other teachings from the scriptural collections that were given from Rongton Chöje's throne, which greatly inspired his mind.

2. How he studied in Central Tibet and Tsang, which has two parts:
2.1 First, how he studied in Central Tibet:

At that time, when the great Rongton gave an empowerment of White Wrathful One [Acala] from the lineage of Khenchen Yakpa of the new teachings, he declared to the assembly, "Acala has dissolved into the head of this small-bodied, big-headed Khampa from among the hundred Khampa monks," which amazed everyone and became a source of praise.

In brief, studying the root text of Prajñāpāramitā during that year's summer and autumn teaching sessions with the great Rongton, although there were inconceivably many Indian and Tibetan commentators on the Abhisamayālaṅkāra, the main ones were Ārya [Vimuktisena] and Haribhadra. He perfectly comprehended both their individual interpretations and the unique interpretation of the root text itself, becoming unrivaled in teaching the scriptural traditions.

According to some biographies, he heard the general teachings on Vinaya from Marton Gyatso Rinchen. He served as an attendant to his autumn teacher called Lorin and traveled to the Kyishö region to give teachings. In Lhasa, he met Lingme Paṇḍita Sherab Palden and offered him dry and wet tea. He received the transmission of the Nāmasaṅgīti and the oral instructions on reciting the Dharmrāja prayer that are now known as the unique recitation method of the Dharmrāja prayer, which were given after meditating on Mañjuśrī and Sakya Paṇḍita as inseparable.

He received those oral instructions for recitation that are now known as the unique recitation method of the Dharmrāja prayer. As many amazing stories about previous masters like Khenchen Yakpa were being told, his mind was irresistibly drawn in, thinking "I too must become like that." Then he gave teachings during his circuit of Zadchushul, which greatly inspired his mind, and he returned to Nālandā. On the fourteenth day of the twelfth lunar month of that year, the great Rongton departed for another realm, so it seems he was unable to study with him for long.

2. How he heard the teachings, which has three parts:
2.1 How he heard the teachings of the scriptural collections
2.2 How he heard the tantric teachings
2.3 The common accomplishments of these two

2.1 First: When he reached twenty-one years of age, in the female earth-snake year, thinking he must find a learned spiritual friend under whom he could complete his studies of the vast scriptural collections, and since the great Rongton was no longer present, he wondered who would be best. At that time, he remembered that when he had previously asked Rongton for advice about where he should go to complete his studies of the scriptural collections, Rongton had said, "My student Jamchen Rabjampa has established a thunderous center of teaching and learning at Kharag Bodrug in the dragon year. You should study there. It will be of great benefit to the teachings." So he set out properly for the great master Jamchen Rabjampa. Taking the shorter route, when he reached the area of Ruskar Cave, he fell into the Yangtse River from a cliff path.

When he fell into the Yangtse River from a cliff path, he recited the unique method of the Dharmrāja prayer while visualizing Sakya Paṇḍita at his crown, and during the time he recited the Great Dharmrāja prayer twenty-four times, he remained in a whirlpool of the river. Some travelers who appeared on the cliff above saw him and lowered many ropes tied together, which he grasped with his hands, enabling him to reach the top of the cliff unharmed. This was undoubtedly a sign that the Lord of Dharma, Sakya Paṇḍita, who is inseparable from Mañjuśrī, was constantly protecting him without even a moment's neglect. Those travelers were undoubtedly none other than emanations of the guru Mañjuśrī himself. From this example, one should understand that whoever takes refuge while reciting the names of the guru Mañjuśrī and his lineage will discover such a treasury of blessings. That this is so was acknowledged by this lord himself, as he said in his own words, "It seems I was guided by Sakya Paṇḍita through many lifetimes, for I had great faith in his works and they came easily to my mind. When I made lamp offerings and prayers before his statue regarding points that were difficult to understand or about which I had doubts, I understood them exactly as they were. Also, when I prayed about obstacles such as harmful spirits and the like, they were pacified. ".

Then he went to meet the renowned lord of speech, Jamchen Rabjampa Sangye Pel, who dwelled beyond the white circular mountain range. Upon meeting him, the lord of speech said, "Rongton Chenpo prophesied to me that you would bring great benefit to the teachings," and he was very pleased. He joined the assembly of advanced scholars during that teaching session. From then on, for five years, he studied under this lord of speech: the explanations of the Five Dharmas of Maitreya along with their respective commentaries; the Pramāṇasamuccaya with auto-commentary and Jinendra's commentary; the Pramāṇavārttika with eight great commentaries; the Pramāṇayukti with auto-commentary and Yagdrong's commentary; the Vinaya including the Prātimokṣasūtra commentary in fifty sections along with the extensive commentary on the root text; the Puṣpamālā tantra with Rongton's commentary; and on Abhidharma, he studied the root text of the Abhidharmakośa with Rongton's commentary, along with the auto-commentary and whatever other commentaries were available; a very extensive explanation of the Abhidharmasamuccaya with the Āryaputra commentary; on Madhyamaka, the root and commentary of the Bodhicaryāvatāra according to the three and four traditions; the Suhṛllekha; the Sūtrasamuccaya; thorough explanations of many minor sūtras including the Prajñāpāramitāhṛdaya; furthermore, the latter four collections of reasoning, the Ratnāvalī, all the collections of praises including the Prajñāpāramitāstotra; and limitless explanatory transmissions of the Nāmasamgīti, Bhadracaryā, and others.

He arrived at Kyetshal, and after a monastic college had been established there for one year, he was very pleased to see that the monks, though rough, were of pure conduct and their teaching and study had greatly flourished. He offered whatever food provisions and tea he had. It seemed that Rongton Chenpo possessed clairvoyance. He thought that this Rabjam Chöje was an emanation of Śākyamuni Buddha, and his retinue were emanations of Ānanda and others, and that this Kyetshal was like Vulture Peak Mountain. Faith and devotion arose in him, and he applied himself with great diligence to his studies. Due to his own great intellectual capacity and vast foundation of learning, combined with the favorable conditions of having skilled teachers, his understanding and debating skills in all the collections of teachings expanded like a summer lake. All the analytical scholars at that monastic college unanimously declared that he must surely be someone whose karmic propensities from studying the meaning of the Buddha's words over many lifetimes had awakened, saying it would be impossible to achieve such results in a single lifetime through study alone, no matter how great one's intelligence. Jamchen Rabjampa, thinking that he would become a great spiritual friend who would benefit the teachings, held him in very high regard, calling him "the great-headed Khampa. " At that time, Jamchen Rabjampa told the king who turned the wheel of power, Rinpung Norbu Zangpo, "Among my students there is a scholarly Khampa like Śāriputra. As I hope he will become a great spiritual friend who will benefit the teachings in the future, he needs support for clothing and provisions. ".

As soon as he received this excellent command wherein [Rinpung Norbu Zangpo] said "Of course, yes! Very good!" he instructed the householder bodhisattva and senior steward Ra Lö Dorje to provide continuous support for Gorampa's clothing and provisions without interruption. The senior steward, following these instructions, provided regular allowances for daily provisions and also offered whatever fine woolen cloth was appropriate for robes each year. Thus, without having to worry about clothing and provisions, [Gorampa] could focus solely on his studies, which was an extremely great kindness. Moreover, it appears there are many historical accounts of how these Rinpung rulers had great devotion to the Dharma and performed powerful deeds in support of the Sakya teachings. Through his two-fold diligence in studying the scriptural collections, his unobstructed knowledge of all textual traditions became as clear as the sun disc. The white jewel of his fame as the foremost among the disciples cherished like the apple of Rabjam Chöje's eye adorned the ears of the maidens of all directions. The garland of praise from all the brilliant minds who gathered like clouds to receive the nectar of his excellent explanations repeatedly extolled him, and the offerings of respect and homage became ornaments for the ocean of brilliant minds. Through uniting compassion that delights in all beings without cause and wisdom realizing the nature of reality, he attained the position of a great physician who removes all the thorns of suffering from beings afflicted by hundreds of karmic and afflictive diseases during this degenerate age.

In accordance with his mastery of the three [skills] - exposition, debate, and composition - he achieved eloquence that pleases the Victorious Ones, flowing like a river, thus becoming the seventh ornament beautifying Jambudvīpa. Through proclaiming the mighty lion's roar of reasoning based on the power of facts, he made the three realms tremble. Having gained mastery over all the vast and profound scriptural treasuries, he became the helmsman of all the inner secrets of the Victorious One and his spiritual heirs. With his mind set on serving the doctrine in general and particularly his guru and monks, when he turned twenty-five, in the Female Water-Bird year known as "Glorious Face" (dpal gdong), he began to conduct teachings for more than a hundred monks, both senior and junior. When all the main monastic houses of Ü and Tsang gathered, he had to go to Sangpu due to the rules concerning construction work at the Ökhang. At that time, in reality, it was as if the deities delighting in virtue had cast an evil spell, fearing that since he was satisfied solely with the profound meaning of the profound secret mantras and scriptural collections, he might not extensively engage with the Vajrayāna path. Although outwardly it appeared as if digging earth and raising dust had caused it, he contracted a severe illness connected with lower spirits that affected his body like leprosy. Immediately after completing the construction work at Ökhang, wishing to request instructions beneficial for his illness, he went to meet Gewa Gyaltsen, a direct disciple of the great Rongton who was a master of both scholarship and accomplishment, a lord of reasoning whom everyone greatly respected, who was staying at Dratang.

Having received teachings on the Seven Realizations [rtogs bdun], some instructions on Vajrabhairava, and the authorization for Iron-Sword Hayagrīva and others, he stayed there for a while practicing, but no apparent benefit manifested. At that time, Master Gewa [Gyaltsen] and his disciples were surrounded by a garden of trees, and there was a very pleasant meadow adorned with various flowers. He went there to pay his respects during the summer viewing. There, he engaged in conversation with a famous teacher from Dratang named Geshé Chakdor Gyaltsen. Through his responses, using the sharp weapon of reasoning that could not be reversed, he cut the opponent's misconceptions to pieces and responded with confident eloquence. When he instantly revealed a contrapositive of one of the difficult-to-recite four pervasions of the Collected Topics without hesitation, Master Gewa was extremely pleased and said, "I thought you were just an old monk since you have the title 'Rabjam,' but you understand logic well. Where did you study?" When he replied that he had studied under Jamchen Rabjampa, [Gewa] said, "That makes sense. He used to study Collected Topics with me, so those who study with him tend to understand logic." From then on, due to his appreciation, he would frequently visit to give advice beneficial for both immediate and long-term concerns. Then he traveled to the pleasure grove of Drongkar in Dré. When his story was related, the Master said, "When I said he understands logic, that was an unprecedented case of direct perception." 2. Next, as his illness had not worsened, he thought to himself:

In considering that his illness had not worsened significantly, he thought: "One cannot know how long the lifespans of the Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo and his spiritual sons will last. My own illness also appears difficult to cure quickly. It is taught that obstacles such as illness can serve as forerunners of spiritual attainments when completing the ocean-like conduct of the Victorious One's heirs. Although many methods for transforming adverse conditions into the path of enlightenment appear in the Buddha's words and the treatises of the great chariot-bearers, dharma derived solely from reasoning and texts without the lineage of experiential instruction is not the path that pleases the Victorious One. Therefore, I shall don the extraordinary armor of pure intention to simultaneously engage in hearing, contemplation, and meditation after requesting countless ripening and liberating instructions from Kunga Zangpo and his spiritual sons."

When he presented this request to Rabjam Chöjé at Ewam, the master said, "Previously, you had great scholarly qualities in the philosophical vehicle, and now you have become skilled in the path of Vajrayāna. This will benefit the doctrine in general." With a mind at ease, [the master] wrote a letter to Rinpung Norbu Zangpo stating that this Rabjampa possessed inconceivable qualities of scriptural knowledge and realization, had mostly eliminated doubts regarding the collections of scriptures, and had gone to Ewam Chöden to study the Vajrayāna, requesting necessary provisions. In response, permission was granted for both teacher and student to receive monthly provisions from Samdrub Tsé. At the feet of the great Vajradhara, this Gobo Rabjampa...

In accordance with Śrī Candrakīrti's statement:
"Pure in moral discipline and equal to space,
Endowed with wisdom and single in thought,
Teaching properly from the sound of learning—
Such instructions are like jewels,"

Since he was a worthy vessel who had become a recipient of teaching, he composed a petition explaining the need for support in both temporal and spiritual matters in order to request the profound dharma of the glorious Sakyapas, beginning with the precious Transmission of the Victorious Ones. He arrived at Ewam in the Bird year. Upon merely seeing the face-maṇḍala of the great Vajradhara, he attained what seemed like the Ground of Joy, with his hair standing on end from faith and joy. First, he received the Hevajra empowerment according to the Commentary tradition. Then, together with Chudu Khetsung Yönten Gyatsopa and others, when receiving the Sambhūti Vajradhātu empowerment, during the teaching authorization, [the master] blew the conch of the empowerment substances three times and said, "You have great fame!" When he blew it three times, a very loud sound emerged, and [the master] smiled and prophesied, "In accordance with your fame, you will accomplish great enlightened activities." This prophecy became evident to all.

From then until the Male Fire-Mouse year called "The Holder," for nearly four years, he primarily received the complete instructions of the precious Transmission of the Victorious Ones with Path and Result twice. Through the four empowerments' ritual for the four support maṇḍalas, he planted the potent seeds of the four kāyas, and by meditating on the four paths, he realized the view and investigated the four philosophical systems.

Through the four oral transmissions that can independently lead to the four results, while investigating the four philosophical systems and realizing the view, he received instructions. The river of empowerments during both causal and path times did not diminish. The lineage of blessings remained unbroken as unmistaken experience arose in his mind. The essence of instructions remained pure as he knew how to transform all experiences, both flawed and flawless, into meditative concentration. Having developed definite recognition of the guru as Buddha, he fulfilled the aspirational devotion. In connection with this, he received many scriptural transmissions including the biographies of the guru lineage, volume transmissions, and others. He received profound paths, protective blessings of Vīra, blessings of Khecarī, and others. Furthermore, preceded by the four methods, he thoroughly received according to the Sakya tradition: the root tantra Hevajra in Two Sections, the uncommon explanatory tantra Vajrapañjara, the common explanatory tantra Samputitantra along with its latter part. He also received explanatory instructions on the Sarvadurgatipariśodhana Tantra, Cakrasaṃvara Root Tantra, and Yoginī Caryā, many empowerments of non-dual tantras such as the Instruction Tradition of Hevajra, both Cakrasaṃvara Luipa and Drilbupa traditions, many mother tantra empowerments such as Ḍākinī Ocean, Guhyasamāja Ārya tradition, Red Yamāri Five Deities, Vajrabhairava Earth tradition and other father tantra empowerments. He received countless empowerments including many yoga tantra empowerments such as the Twelve Purification Maṇḍalas, many carya tantra empowerments such as the Five Deities of Arapacana, kriyā tantra empowerments such as the general empowerment of the Three Families, and numerous empowerments related to all four classes of tantra.

Regarding the initiations of a hundred and two oceans of sādhanas, Avalokiteśvara of Nyakyer Gang tradition, Tārā tradition, White and Blue Acala, Amitāyus, White Tārā, Vijaya, Parnasabarī, Kurukullā, Kāmadeva, Pañjanātha and others, he received many authorizations for minor deities related to the four activities. He received instructions on the Four Stages of the Black One [Vajrabhairava], Five Stages of Ghaṇṭapāda tradition, Life-force instructions of White Cakrasaṃvara, Five Stages of Guhyasamāja instructions, extensive explanation of generation stage, instructions on the unelaborate Red Yamāri, instructions on Freedom from Four Attachments, Jetsun's songs on Freedom from Four Attachments, instructional texts by Sapan and Nuppa Rigdzin Drak, Seventeen Minor Sūtras with Chim's outline, Five Royal Sūtras with Phakpa's outline, Eight Thousand [Prajñāpāramitā], Letter to a Friend, Ratnāvalī and countless others. Then, regarding how he received teachings from other Ngor tradition-holding masters, to express it in one place without disturbing the outline sections: From the great being Khapyarwa, he received the empowerment of Condensed Vajra Clan, empowerments of Twelve Purification Maṇḍalas, Hayagrīva Iron Sword, Vajrapāṇi Ucchusma Lion's Roar, Orange Mañjuśrī, and authorizations for Nyendrö and others. From the great scholar Gungru Sherab Zangpo, he received the Ḍākinī Ocean empowerment, authorization of Great Red Gaṇapati, many explanations of the Distinction of the Three Vows, explanation of Sarvavid Benefiting Others' Light, root text and commentary on Thathā's lines, and instructions including methods for drawing Abhaya's minor lines.

From Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo, he received all teachings that the great being himself had received, in the manner of filling a vase completely.

Regarding his teachings, there are two [types of] transmissions - the long transmission and the short transmission.

Having combined into one account all teachings received from the Great Bodhisattva at different times for the sake of broader conventional usage, this sequence of how he received teachings from the Ngor tradition masters is also arranged for ease of conventional expression. Therefore, one should not raise objections claiming it's not exactly as it happened.

Furthermore, he received from masters such as the Lord Zhalu-pa, Master Chumik-pa Lodrö Wangchuk, and Master Gyakar Sherab Gyaltsen various permissions including those of Gurmön and golden-yellow Mañjuśrī.

In brief, having reached the far shore of the ocean of learning, he became the unique wish-fulfilling gem equal to particles of earth for fortunate disciples with merit and karma who desired liberation.

When he reached twenty-six years of age, in the male Wood-Dog year called "Entity," he went to E-waṃ [monastery] of the Great Bodhisattva and thought thus: "Having properly received from my previous teachers the vows of a fully qualified upāsaka, intermediate ordination, and śrāmaṇera vows with the ten training bases, until now I have not damaged these vows through transgressions. Though there is nothing like shame in the minds of those with dharma vision who carefully enter among the disciplined ones, nevertheless, a śrāmaṇera is one who has entered but not completed [the path]. The essence of the teachings is the bhikṣu vows of one who has entered and fully completed [the path], as taught repeatedly by the Victor and his sons. In terms of the definitive meaning, even the great sage, the Blessed One, renounced the wealth of universal monarchy, exchanged priceless clothes for saffron robes, left home for homelessness, and took ordination before the pure stūpa. Later, after six years of hardship, at Magadha's Vajrāsana under the Bodhi tree, he defeated Māra's forces represented by Makara in the evening, and at dawn simultaneously attained the nectar of undefiled [wisdom] and full ordination vows, then turned the wheel of Dharma for the three types of beings.

I will translate all the complete sentences found in the text:

Thinking "I too should properly take full ordination vows and, having established countless fortunate disciples in the discipline of definite renunciation of pure conduct, guide them on the authentic path," he requested full ordination from Lord Vajradhara.

The Lord said, "Since you are destined to become a great holder of the Sakya teachings in the future, my lineage of full ordination vows is not the one transmitted from Sakya Paṇḍita. The lineage transmitted from Sakya Paṇḍita is with Master Khapharwa, so request him as preceptor. I will act as karma master."

Then both teacher and student together requested Khapharwa, but Khapharwa replied, "How could I possibly act [as preceptor] when a master like the Lord is present? I also cannot be the karma master. Please request Master Charalwa."

When he would not agree, then from the Noble White Lotus Dharma [text]: "Kunga Zangpo, my dharma holder, having made offerings to six million Sugatas, will become victorious in future times."

And from the Noble Sūtra of the Bodhisattva Collection called "Thoroughly Maintaining the Roots of Virtue": "At that time, manifesting as the World Protector's emanation, the monk Kunga Zangpo will appear, distinguished by his moral discipline, exalted through vast learning and perfections, thoroughly trained in method and wisdom, his mind-stream of dharma never forgetting, always associating with the noble ones."

Following the prophecies, the Blessed Avalokiteśvara and attendants of the Sage like Ānanda intentionally took human birth in this Land of Snows. Through the great Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo acting as preceptor, Muschen Sempa Chenpo Könchok Gyaltsen as karma master, Charwa Khenchen Sempa Chenpo Sönam Gyaltsen as secret instructor, and the pure upholder of vows Sangye Paldrub as timekeeper, along with a complete assembly of suitable supplementary monks, he properly received full ordination as a bhikṣu. After ordination, his conduct was like one who had been ordained for a hundred years. He maintained the middle path that avoided the two extremes of sensual indulgence and exhausting asceticism. He undertook practices that generated wisdom, produced knowledge, and led to peace. He cherished moral discipline like the apple of his eye and dwelled in conduct like that of Upāli, who was prophesied to be supreme among holders of the Vinaya. Although Lord Radönpa explains that Charwa acted as karma master, this appears as written in all other biographies. As for explaining Charwa's name as Sangye Paldrub, this must be an error of the scribe or printer, because Sangye Paldrub was the name of the ascetic from Lowo.

That night, following the permission of Kurukullā that was to be bestowed the next day at the feet of Vajradhara, he dreamed that a woman wearing dark red silk garments offered him a handful of fresh fruit and said "Eat this!" Then she offered him a red drum and said "Beat this!" When he beat it, the sound filled entire world-systems. This was definitively a true sign of the blessing of the ḍākinīs and that his fame would pervade the reaches of space.

When he reached twenty-seven years of age, in the female wood-pig year called "Possessing Merit," his previous illness had worsened. Thinking to travel to Kham for his health, he went to Kyedmé Tshal. When he met with Rabjam Chöjé and explained his reasons, Chöjé said, "If you go to Kham, people will not come. In particular, you must consult with Lord Sempa Chenpo," and did not let him go. He submitted a petition requesting Lord Sempa Chenpo not to let him go to Kham. When he brought this petition to Sempa Chenpo, Sempa Chenpo said, "How could it be appropriate for a Geshé like you to go to Kham? When this severe illness is cured, there is a chance you could rival even someone like Butön Khache in beneficial activities. For now, stay at Ewam. If this illness improves, you will need to go to Dzongkar." Accepting these words, he went to Ngor. At that time, although provisions were extremely scarce due to the famine year, wearing only tattered cotton robes, he did not postpone his diligent studies. After completing the evening practices without fail, [he studied] the auto-commentary to the Rigs gter.

At the monastery of Rigs gter he studied texts such as the Pramāṇa Treasury Auto-commentary [Rigs gter rang 'grel], the Sambhuṭi Commentary with its Essential Illumination, the Pure Version of the Hevajra Two Sections with supplements, the Guhyagarbha with ornamental commentaries, the two trees of general classifications teaching the four methods, the Commentary on Praise of Selflessness, the Elimination of Confusion Regarding Root Downfalls, and the Clear Differentiation of the Three Vows, reviewing them daily. Sometimes when he engaged in analyzing difficult points of doubt, there were occasions when he didn't notice dawn breaking or the sun rising. At that time, although his illness was severe, all doubts were cut through.

This was just as it is said that for holy beings, adverse conditions manifest as glory. Although his robes were extremely thin, he could not wear the cotton monastic robes offered by Vajradhara. The treasurer Gyalrin offered him an old zha thul (a type of garment) which he accepted. Then when he requested teachings from Vajradhara that would help with his illness, the Lord said, "For illness, one needs to know how to be liberated from illness. Since your body is in very poor condition, drink as much butter soup as you can."

Feeling somewhat discouraged at this, he neither gave teachings nor drank butter soup, thinking only "there is no butter" but without developing wrong views. Then after several days, he went to make offerings before Lord Kadrug-mar. When he explained his reasons for going to Mus, [the Lord] said, "Stay here today. You may go after that." The next day when he stayed, nothing became clear. Thinking he definitely needed to leave the following day, he went to sleep that night and dreamed that a man wearing white clothes said, "This body needs to be washed, so you should take a bath." When asked what to wash with...

He was asked "What should I wash with?" and was told "Wash with this vase!" whereupon he was handed four vases of different colors filled with four different kinds of water. A red man handed him a skull cup filled with excellent chang and said, "First drink this, then take your bath. " As soon as he finished drinking the chang, four differently colored men appeared, each holding a vase, and gave him a bath. When he awoke and reflected on this, he thought it might be an omen that his spiritual practice would increase if he went to Mus. Rising early in the morning, he went with some hesitation to Nyachumik. After completing one inner circumambulation, someone said "The master has instructions - please return," so he went back. That day, they performed the preparations for the Five Red Executioner Deities. That night, he had many dreams that cannot be described. On the day of completing the main empowerment, without having to do anything else, his illness vanished completely, like a snake shedding its skin. This caused him to develop extraordinary faith in the guru and his mind-vase was filled to overflowing with the extraordinary blessing nectar of the guru and yidam deities. 3. The common accomplishments of these two: In his thirty-first year, the earth-female-hare year called "Possessing Intoxication," at the persistent urging of Chenpo Yeshe Gyaltsen, he developed the intention to go to Kham. Before Lord Sempa Chenpo entered retreat in the dragon year, he completed making offerings without needing to journey to Kham. When he reached thirty-two years of age, at the dawn of the iron-male-dragon year called "Hero," he made preparations to set out on the eastern road.

Through his complete mastery of the scriptural traditions along with their correct paths of interpretation - including sutras, tantras, and their commentaries - established by those renowned as the great charioteers of the Land of Snows, he reached the far shore of the ocean of learning. By precisely untying all the subtle knots of difficult points within the entirety of the Buddha's teachings and the treatises of the great charioteers, he gained mastery over the jewel-island of reasoning born from contemplation. Through his constant diligence in implementing the meaning examined through hearing and contemplation, he became a lord of experience and realization, thus spontaneously accomplishing the two purposes. By serving all his teachers through the three ways of serving and pleasing them through the three ways of pleasing, they considered him their peerless chief disciple and cherished him like the apple of their eye, whereby he became the regent who turned the wheel of all the buddhas' enlightened activities. By filling the three realms with his white fame, he inflicted wounds of sorrow in the hearts of all those of the dark side. Through his ability to make the hundred-petaled pleasure grove of the Buddha's teachings smile in all directions with rays of excellent explanations, he caused Indra's adorned palace to tremble and received praise from all the buddhas. Through striking with the vajra wheel of reasoning born from the expanse of wisdom's sky, he made the hearts of all opponent proponents of wrong views tremble. Through manifestly gathering the great ship of ripening and liberation together with the oar of pure intention - containing all translated scriptures and treatises along with the excellent explanations of Tibetan scholars and masters -

Through crossing the ocean-like source of saṃsāric crocodiles, he became a captain for those desiring to reach the precious island of liberation. Like a skilled captain who takes precious jewels from the wish-fulfilling ocean treasury and makes them rain down whatever is desired in his homeland, he directly met with his kind parents who bestowed this precious human body endowed with freedoms and advantages, and others. Having shown them the path of temporary benefit and lasting happiness, he thought "I shall establish them in the dharma kingdom of the Sun's Friend (Buddha), beyond the domain of the Lord of Others' Emanations." With great joy and delight in himself, he set out for whatever regions of the great land of Tibet where his navel cord was cut, arriving at Deyul Kyétshal. When he met with Rabjam Chöjé and explained his reasons for traveling to Kham, Rabjam Chöjé thought "It would be a waste to send such a Geshé to Kham. He is suitable for our monastery seat" and said "You should not go to Kham but stay here to teach and study." He privately had petition letters submitted to both Rinpung Norbu Zangpo and Sempa Chenpo. Although the Dharma King Norbu Zangpo sent strict orders that he must stay, when he earnestly explained his reasons including needing to meet his parents, the Lord said "In that case, since Lord Sempa Chenpo is the one we both should petition for advice, we must send a request and follow whatever instructions he gives." He sent the elder Yeshe Gyaltsen to Mus to request guidance from Sempa Chenpo.

Within the innermost sacred meditation, [Sempa Chenpo] said: "Although he has now been entrusted with affection for his monastery seat, it will be difficult for him to become the actual seat-holder in the future. If he goes to Kham, he will have great wealth but not a long life, and his enlightened activities will be limited. If he stays in Central Tibet and Tsang, though his wealth will be somewhat less, his life will be somewhat longer and his enlightened activities will be very extensive. Therefore, it would be best for him to stay in Central Tibet and Tsang, wherever he may be. " After this message arrived, the elder Yeshe Gyaltsen was sent to Kham. This master remained at Dréyul. At that time, during a general tea gathering, Rabjam Chöjé said: "Now at our monastery, there are inconceivably many spiritual friends who have attained mastery in explanation of the Buddha's words and their commentaries. At this time, through informal discussion, we must definitively establish the meaning of the words of the great charioteers' scriptures. Therefore, let Kachupa Tensel take his thesis examination on the Rigs gter (Treasury of Reasoning), let Gorampa take his thesis examination on the Domsum Rabyé (Three Vows), and let Rabjampa Sang Lhün take his thesis examination on the Abhidharmasamuccaya. Let the learned geshés engage in debate!"

When this instruction was given, Tsethong Rabjampa Sangyé Lhündrub, who was blessed by White Mañjuśrī, became accomplished as a minor lord of speech. His banner of pride and arrogance touched the peak of existence. His scholarly fame spread beyond the surrounding mountain ranges. His disciples multiplied like stars in the sky. The waves of his teaching, debating and composition moved in endless ripples. His confident speech and proud roar resounded like a hundred thousand thunderclaps.

Regarding scriptural authority and reasoning, since there was one who destroyed the crowns of all opponents with armies [of logic], it was enough that I made my thesis statement. It was said that the throat chakra of enjoyment's channels opened, and like flashes of lightning from his tongue, he expounded various oral teachings including commentaries and sub-commentaries on the higher and lower Abhidharma, and the views of earlier and later Tibetan masters. As he arranged the heaps of maṇḍala offerings, Rabjam Chöjé said, "There is nothing but sleepiness from these messy explanations. Now state a complete thesis." When this was said, [Gorampa] refuted Panglochenpö's position and stated that according to the system of the Sautrāntikas and below, mind and mental factors are substantially different entities. Then, although many learned scholars engaged in extensive exchanges of scriptural authority and reasoning from different perspectives, nothing effective emerged. Then [Rabjam Chöjé] said, "I request to hear our master engage in a debate." Although he was renowned for his wisdom and scholarship, since he had not engaged in reasoning and scriptural authority for about eight years, he had some verbal hesitation. Thinking "Today I will debate him and become unrivaled," he immediately rose, removed his hat and said, "Let the entire assembly of monks listen! Gorampa has challenged me to a debate." Then, as the progression of scriptural authority and reasoning went upward and reached its peak, he removed his ceremonial scarf and made some gestures of distress, saying "Nobody but me has understood this at the root of this tree."

At that point, [Gorampa] said: "It would absurdly follow that those that arise as retinue to a primary mind would not become primary in relation to that primary mind, because mind and mental factors are substantially different entities. " [The opponent] accepted this. "Then it would absurdly follow that undefiled wisdom is the primary factor of Abhidharma, because it is stated 'Abhidharma is stainless wisdom along with its followers. '" [The opponent] replied that he accepted this as well. "If something is undefiled wisdom, it necessarily follows that it is the primary factor of Abhidharma, because you accept it. " When this was stated, [the opponent] again accepted. "Then if something is the primary factor of Abhidharma, it necessarily follows that it must be primary in relation to the primary mind that possesses it in its retinue, because undefiled wisdom is the primary factor of Abhidharma. " [The opponent] replied that he accepted this. "Then it would follow that the great undefiled wisdom that is concomitant with the primary mind [is primary], because of that reason. "

After merely stating these three points, [Rabjam Chöjé] said regarding the discussion, "I was influenced by pride. " Then, recalling his previous words and unable to bear having disrespected the lama, he drove a nail into that good wooden post. He ran through the middle corridor. After running back and forth many times while speaking many harsh words, when he looked at [Gorampa's] face, beads of black sweat had appeared. The great and learned Byams chen was extremely pleased and offered the good wooden post that he had removed. That very day, he offered inconceivable garlands of praise and acclaim. The monks were amazed and unanimously declared that since he had not engaged in logic and scriptural authority for such a long time, this must have been either due to the blessing of his chosen deity or the arising of wisdom born from meditation.

In the autumn of that year, Tsethong Rabjampa went to teach at Kyangthur in Upper Nyang. When Khedrub Tenpa Rabsel went to Ewam to request the Path and Fruit teachings from Sempa Chenpo, the master himself took on all responsibilities for supplementary teachings. His garland of precious eloquent explanations beautifully adorned the throats of all intelligent ones, and his fame spread far.

In his thirty-fourth year, the Water-Horse year called "Various," one day two women with very red faces appeared and requested to prepare tea for the assembly. While boiling the tea, they used up to two measures of tea. After making some praises and serving the tea, the two women who had prepared the assembly tea were nowhere to be found. All the small ritual vessels and tea containers were filled with blood. Then a severe epidemic struck the monastery. Despite performing ritual proclamations and other methods, nothing could stop it until they had the assembly chant the Short Praise to Je Tsun Drapa. When they gave mantra-blessed water to the sick people, having each recite it one hundred times, all recovered and the epidemic ceased.

During this time, in a dream Lord Sempa Chenpo appeared and made many gestures of approval, saying "You have benefited many beings." Then, during a lunar eclipse, he dreamed that a white person placed a white conch shell upright, which grew larger and larger until finally it became completely full.

At that time, this was considered an omen that his activities of teaching and learning would increase. During that period, all of Central Tibet and Tsang were afflicted by an epidemic of jaundice, which also spread in the monastic college. The monks could not engage in studies and had to focus solely on ritual ceremonies. The master and disciples maintained very strict retreat, during which the master primarily performed the fire offering ritual to supplement the approaching practice of Vajrabhūmi, along with the simplified fire offering of Yamāntaka. At the end of that year, both master and disciples engaged very intensively in teaching and learning.

In his thirty-fifth year, the Water-Female-Sheep year, at Chuzang Monastery in Central Tibet, on the evening before he was scheduled to give teachings the next morning, he was struck with a severe illness and could not attend. Due to the Dharma Lord's great hopes, he remained constantly ill like an artificial geshe or a small monkey. The Dharma Lord applied pressure to his pulse point saying, "Have you not received similar instructions at Ngor? Now maintain strict retreat. By the time I arrive back, either be dead or be healed!" This stern command greatly disturbed him. He thought, "For this illness, I will not rely on doctors or medical treatments. I will determine life or death through spiritual practice alone." At that time, during the evening prayers when the powerful master mantrin Rinchen Namgyal was performing ritual ceremonies, he saw a king who was creating obstacles for this master and asked him, "Where did you come from? What is your reason for creating obstacles for this lama?" He replied, "I am the king of Gu. We of Gu had our great wealth stolen by the Glo-bo people."

He reported this to Dharma Lord Kunga Zangpo at Ewam. He was unable to see him in person. [The king] said, "I am creating obstacles because in the future, a great holder of the Ngorpa tradition will come. "

After explaining these reasons to him, when requested to perform focused spiritual practice for this situation, he primarily meditated on the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, and on the mind of enlightenment through giving and taking [tonglen]. One day, a very large black man, using the southern mountain of a garden as his seat, embraced and tightly held this lord. Thinking "Try to eat me if you can - I allow it," he merged awareness with basic space. When he relaxed and released, thinking "Can I create an obstacle for you?" [the figure] said "You are frightened" and disappeared like a rainbow. After that, he experienced a fundamental healing. He also acknowledged that he directly realized in his mind-stream the Experience-Based Valid Cognition, which is one of the Four Valid Cognitions of the Oral Transmission. When he later taught the Path with Its Fruit [Lamdre] at Serling, he said that by meditating on the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, a severe lung illness he had was cured. Similarly, on one occasion at Lingdo, during summer, he said that by meditating on the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, an excellent realization arose. At that time, in a dream, he was about to receive the Hevajra Cause empowerment from Lord Sempa Chenpo. He dreamed very clearly of offering the mandala of approach up through receiving the vase empowerment of the vajra master. At the point when it was said "Having received the vase empowerment, bodily impurities are purified," he awoke from the dream.

The remainder hoped [to receive the empowerments]. Though he went to sleep, the continuation of that dream did not occur. He said it seemed that the phrase "bodily impurities are purified" was a sign of being freed from illness.

On one occasion, when several people came to request full ordination, the Dharma Lord asked, "Have you ever been to the ordination platform at Ngor? Tomorrow we need to train the preceptors. Learn the ritual text and recitations that are needed." [Gorampa] replied, "Being young, I have never been to the Ngor ordination platform, but I have memorized the ritual text." Between that afternoon and the next morning's meditation session, he learned all the necessary recitations. Then in the midst of the sangha, he flawlessly recited without missing even half a word both the mantras for the novice preceptor and the full ordination preceptor, along with their connections and including the eleven instructions at the end.

The omniscient Sangye Pel was extremely pleased and reportedly said, "This is definitely someone who has developed wisdom through meditation and is blessed by their meditation deity. Such capability is impossible for others."

At the end of that year, the Dharma Lord said, "I am going to Mu to request the remaining teachings from Sempa Chenpo for about a year. During that time, my nephew Rabjam will act as my substitute. You should teach the dharma that I have taught. Although previously there was no tradition of offering prostrations to substitute teachers, from today on, everyone should offer prostrations to him." He then empowered him as regent.

At first, though there was no tradition of offering prostrations to substitute teachers, [the Dharma Lord] said, "From today on, everyone should offer prostrations to him," and empowered him as regent. After giving detailed instructions about what needed to be taught, he departed for Mu. Then this lord taught all subjects from the great volumes of the pitakas, starting from the Four Great Treatises, the Four Root and Three Introductory [Texts], the Later Four Dharmas of Maitreya, the Abhidharmakosha, the Two Types of Vinaya, up through mathematics and calculations, exactly as taught by the omniscient Sangye Pel. Unlike others who merely repeat the words of earlier masters or confuse students by randomly mixing whatever comes to mind like reading casual dharma texts, he first established the essential meaning of whatever text he was teaching and resolved all difficult points with his analytical wisdom. Then he taught in a way that was both precise and comprehensive, suited to students' mental capacities and faculties. Through his unwavering dedication to teaching, everyone developed great understanding and diligence in their studies. The monastery flourished just as much as when Rabjam Chöjé was present. Although the great clamor of his scholarly fame filled every wealthy region, and when many essential points of the unique Sakya philosophical tenets newly emerged, a few small-minded ones who had not seen the works of the earlier masters and who took recent minor notes as authoritative could not tolerate it and created some discord between teacher and student. However, since both had the dharma eye, they could not move even a hair on their bodies, and only created karmic wounds on their own necks from the burden of negativity.

During that time, he established countless fortunate ones on the path of ripening and liberation through the five-deity Yamāntaka empowerment, the Vajrabhairava earth system empowerment, many permissions for minor deities, and various profound instructions. He also composed many treatises, greatly clarifying and expanding both the general Buddhist doctrine and particularly the Sakya teachings, which made the monks happily believe that the students were more learned than the teacher.

3. Regarding how he established a new teaching center and conducted teaching and learning primarily focused on the Tripitaka, there are two parts:
1. How he established the teaching center according to the instructions of his holy teacher
2. How he spread the teachings through teaching, debating, and composition

Regarding the first: When Rabjam Chöjé heard about his reputation for increasing teaching and learning and developing great intelligence at Kyedmotsal, he was extremely pleased. After completing the sequence of teachings, when preparing to return at the end of the Monkey year, Rabjam Chöjé appointed the scholar Gorampa to the teaching seat before Sempa Chenpo, saying that the three aspects of maintaining, protecting, and expanding the monastery were no different from himself. He said, "Just as it is said 'The elderly who have passed their prime dwell happily in forest groves of extensive learning,' I think you should primarily practice in a secluded place near Kyedmotsal, and occasionally teach and study tantric teachings."

When asked for advice about where and how to practice, [Rabjam Chöjé] replied, "How could someone like you, who primarily accomplishes their own purpose through practice, need to rely on practice? Since you have taken birth as a scholar-adept for many lifetimes, continuing teaching and learning will be of greater benefit to the doctrine. Therefore, go to the Dré region. I have bestowed our precious Oral Transmission along with its branches completely, like filling a vase, up through the practice authorization."

Following upon the request regarding the Glorious Guhyasamaja, since it had a vast foundation of explanation, [Rabjam Chöjé] said that all was accomplished according to his intention, including the empowerments, reading transmissions, quintessential instructions, tantric lineage teachings, explanations from Indian treatises, and complete teachings on the Chakrasamvara cycle and others. When pressed further, he said, "Gorampa should hear something like the continuation teachings of Chakrasamvara here, and since I hope to establish pure philosophical teachings and studies of the Glorious Sakyapa tradition, take this letter of mine and depart immediately." He then departed.

Upon the master and disciples arriving at Kyimotshal, this was how the meditation instruction and spiritual advice of Lord Sempa Chenpo came: "In my opinion, you should continue your teaching and studies here. I will focus primarily on approach and accomplishment practices. If we teach some tantric dharma as well, it will lead to unity. I thought to submit a petition requesting permission to Lord Sempa Chenpo, as seems appropriate."

In response, this master, having everything necessary regarding the Krishnacharya Chakrasamvara cycle and wishing to request other profound teachings, submitted a request for permission. The permission was graciously granted. He bestowed gifts of robes, horses, tea, porcelain cups, silk fabrics, and whatever provisions and pack animals were needed. With a few attendants, at age thirty-seven, in the first month of the Wood-Bird year called "Earth Protector," he departed for Mü with great joy. There, he bestowed teachings to many interested students from Kham and Tsang, including explanations of tantras and treatises, reading transmissions of the collected works of the Five Sakya Patriarchs and others.

During the transmission of the Marma Commentary, he once developed an extremely severe illness. Thinking of Lord Sempa Chenpo, he lay down with his head pointing toward the residence. In a dream, the entire interior was filled with fragrant aromas. When he looked to see what it was, Lord Sempa Chenpo appeared with an extremely radiant countenance and sprinkled much blessed water on his body. When he awoke, the illness had completely disappeared. This was undoubtedly a genuine sign of having received the blessings of the holy lama.

At that time, the Jamchen Tulku Sönam Chökyi Kunga Tashi Gyaltsen Palzang was also there to request teachings from Sempa Chenpo. Since they developed an extremely close relationship, he said, "A spiritual friend like you should engage in teaching and study that benefits the doctrine. Since it wouldn't be right for you to serve as the throne-holder of Dzongkar now, establish a teaching center. I will also provide whatever support possible."

Although this seemed reasonable to the master himself, he was unsure how to establish it and did not accept.

Again, at that time, a great master-adept like Dönyö Palwa was present, but he was elderly and it was uncertain what would happen. Although previously there was Lord Khyenrab Wangchuk and now there is someone like Sönam Chenmo in his position, it was uncertain what would happen. Since it seemed this one could not spread the pure philosophical view of the Sakyapas, he was repeatedly urged that he must by all means establish [a center]. One evening, after discussing seeking appropriate advice from Lord Sempa Chenpo, in Chöjé Kukyé's dream, many people were constructing a great throne. When asked whose throne it was, someone said it was the Dharma throne of Venerable Drakpa Gyaltsen. The next morning, when the three - master and disciples - met, Kukyé presented the circumstances of the dream and the reasons for establishing teaching and study. Lord Sempa Chenpo was extremely pleased and said this was a very auspicious connection. They had an excellent discussion about establishing teaching and study. At that time, in a dream he saw many golden written texts being opened, and when he looked, all the words were only "Homage to Bhagavati Mahā" [ma hi'i dbang po]. From the Lord's own words: "Although it is said that he stated this seemed to be a sign because there was great activity at that time regarding the visualization and mandala texts of the Yamāntaka earth system that I wrote, it was undoubtedly a sign of being accepted by Bhagavan Vajrabhairava. ".

Having turned thirty-eight, at the beginning of the Fire-Male-Dog year called "Inexhaustible," Lord Sempa Chenpo and Lord Namgyal Drakzang, father and son, invited him to Ngamring. At that time, Sempa Chenpo said, "I will give the stages of instruction on the Path with Its Fruits and other teachings. Gorampa should give extensive explanations analyzing the Three Tantras and other texts." Accordingly, Lord Sempa Chenpo gave many instructions on the Path with Its Fruits, mind training, and other topics to an assembly of about a thousand.

This master, in the manner of supplementary teachings, gave extensive explanations to about five hundred scripture-holders - primarily mentioning the two Buddhas [sang rgyas rnam gnyis] famous as the tenth-level scholar Sangye Pel and Sangye Özer - including:
1. Complete explanation of the Three Hevajra Tantras
2. Extensive explanation of the Three Vows
3. Commentary on the Vajra Verses
4. Reading transmission of the Three Benefit of Others Cycles of the Supreme Ones
5. Commentary on the Guhyasamaja sadhana
6. Explanation of Ngorpa's Three Benefit of Others Cycles
7. Reading transmission of Sempa Chenpo's collected works and others

At that time, he had many discussions about the Sakya tenets with the universal monarch Lord Namgyal Drakpa Palzang who was blessed by the glorious Kālacakra. In particular, he dispelled the wrong view that asserts the body mandala to be ultimately true. In that region, the Bodongpa's "Clear Understanding of Tantra Meaning," a Sarvavid ritual text, had spread. [He showed that] the Bodongpa's own understanding of tantra and all the earlier traditions of Sarvavid like Zhanphen Özer were incorrect.

Having established through scripture and reasoning what appears to be the case, he composed works called "Ascertainment through Scripture" and "Ascertainment through Reasoning. " While these were spreading through teaching and study, when he wished to compose a treatise refuting their misconceptions, in a dream, at a gathering place of the Thane tradition, many monks were constructing a high throne. When asked whose it was, someone said it was the throne for Lord Muspa Chenpo's teaching of the Purification Tantra. This master also assisted, and immediately upon completion, Lord Sempa Chenpo came to sit upon a high white throne and said "Currently in Tibet, no one is more expert than me in the Purification Tantra. If there are those who wish to listen, let them come!" Along with many such proclamations, he gave a detailed and definitive explanation of the Purification Tantra. Previously there was no tradition of making such proclamations, so wondering what this meant now, he listened attentively and understood exactly as taught in the dream. When he awoke, about one page of text was clear in his mind, which he wrote in the "Refutation of Arguments on Sarvavid," and he also understood many difficult points that he had not understood before. At the end of that composition, he wrote: "In a dream on a mountain peak, profound meaning was found / The signs and marks shone brilliantly like sunlight. " This is similar to how it is said that Sakya Pandita dreamed of receiving one complete teaching of Abhidharmakosha from Vasubandhu at the Achi stupa, and upon waking understood all the words and meaning. This is extremely wondrous, for it exemplifies how it is taught that holy beings can benefit from hearing teachings in dreams.

Having carefully examined the objections, Lord Palchö composed many refutations of the Nadkyi Dazer's positions, including "Dispelling Objections to Generation Stage" and other extensive compositions. Thus, when the sun-like wisdom of this master arose in the lotus garden of scriptural studies at Ngamring in the north, it caused the petals of intelligence of all scholars to bloom in a hundred directions. Their bright minds, like bees as numerous as particles in sunlight, were completely satisfied with the fresh honey of elegant explanations, leaving no opportunity for the sounds of others' fame through scripture and reasoning to be heard. Therefore, most of the Sakya geshes of that time became disciples of this master, making his white fame an ornament for the ears in all directions.

At that summer, having invited the Chamchen Trulku, preparations were made to go to Chamchen. When receiving blessings and making aspirations at the feet of Lord Sempa Chenpo, Sempa Chenpo invoked the truth of the root and lineage gurus, ḍākinīs, and dharma protectors, saying "Since this Gorampa Rabjam will properly engage in teaching and learning that benefits both the general doctrine and specifically the Sakya teachings, may he be blessed by the holy gurus. May the ḍākinīs and dharma protectors protect against all adverse conditions and obstacles, and may all favorable conditions be fulfilled as wished." When he gave these instructions, countless experiences arose in his body such as trembling and movement. Then he bestowed excellent gifts including blessed robes, a thousand blessing pills [bdud rtsi ril bu], hundreds of sacred substances [sil ma], and so forth. The Rinpung rulers also promised to be patrons, saying "We too will provide support to the best of our ability. By all means establish a center for pure exposition of Sakya view and tenets." After giving spiritual instructions to the Chamchen Trulku and empowering him as a regent to uphold the Buddha's teachings, he departed for Chamchen. Meeting with the Chamchen Trulku, he presented Sempa Chenpo's spiritual instructions. After discussions, the Trulku said: "To fulfill the wishes of Dharma King Norbu Zangpo: As a support for the body, construct one additional Chamchen [statue] beyond what Trophu has; as a support for speech, establish this new monastic center; as a support for mind, construct a very large enlightenment stupa." These plans were thoroughly discussed with the officials and arrangements were finalized. He gave excellent instructions saying it must be established this year, and thorough discussions were held.

On that occasion, when he met Rabjam Chöjé at Kyimotshal, he presented the history of establishing the monastic college, which greatly pleased him. [Rabjam Chöjé] said, "That is excellent. At first, regardless of whether conditions are favorable or not regarding the number of monks, one must undergo hardships. You yourself know how we established teaching and learning at Druk Gönpa in Tibet. Since Sempa Chenpo has clairvoyance, and once the officials, rulers, and reincarnate lamas of Rinpung provide good patronage, great enlightened activities benefiting the teachings will arise. There is also a good prophecy from Rongtön Chenpo."

Then at Sergading, he performed the approach practice of Cakrasaṃvara Lūhipa and the sādhana of Lama Rinchung until he received signs of blessing. Then, traveling to Tsang, he stayed at Samdrub Tsé for several days to hold discussions with the officials and reincarnate lamas. While traveling upward from there, at Yuba Dong he met someone carrying a gaṇḍī. When the person said he was selling the gaṇḍī, [Gorampa] said this was a very auspicious connection and acquired the gaṇḍī to carry upward. Holy ones have said that person was actually an emanation of Gur Gönpo, which seems truly wondrous.

Then he went to Serling. With the support of the precious reincarnate lama Sönam Chökyi Kunga Tashi Gyaltsen Palzangpo, who had the eye of courage to uphold the burden of both the general Buddhist doctrine and particularly the glorious Sakya teachings, along with the patronage of the universal monarch of power, the great ruler of Tsang, Döndrub Dorjé and his ministers, and with their earnest commission accompanied by excellent tea, in the Fire Male Dog year known as "Inexhaustible" in India, on the fifteenth day of the twelfth Mongolian month during the star of Victory, he established the monastic college with about sixty monks. Shangpa Kachu Zangpo Tashi was appointed as chant leader, and Samdrub Tsé pa Kachu Tenpa Dargyé committed to serve as disciplinarian for three years, thus establishing the initial auspicious connections for excellent accumulations.

At that time, from the precious reincarnate lama, one thousand units of goods [khal stong ra ma] and the newly established comprehensive revenue from Rikhü Chödé were applied to the Dharma estate. Regarding the first, it appears to be the current thousand units of provisions for winter teachings. Dharma King Döndrub Dorjé formally established regular provisions for this master from Samdrub Tsé in the ledger. Through the blessing of the master and disciples, he established regular summer and winter provisions from Rikhü. Similarly, Lord Officer Yungpa Tsewang Tashi also offered monthly contributions from Urgyen Dzong and Dokhar Gangrik. From the very beginning, having received instructions from Tsewang Gönpo and others, he regarded him as supreme among lamas and showed him great respect. Then at the beginning of composing his monastic regulations, after writing praises to the Three Jewels and the lamas beginning with "Buddha, the sun, ornament of all worlds," he spoke these words regarding the occasion: "Regarding our tradition of teaching and learning, since Lord Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo was extremely pleased with the scriptural teaching and learning, and since Great Sempa Chenpo Muspa Chenpo directly instructed to establish teaching and learning of sutra and tantra, with the patronage of Dharma Lord Sönam Chökyi Kunga Tashi Drakpa Gyaltsen Palzangpo, this was established at Tanak Serling Monastery on the fifteenth day of the full moon under the star of Victory in the Fire Male Dog year, for the purpose of spreading the Buddha's teachings in general.

Having established this for the sake of preserving many essential points of excellent philosophical tenets in particular, and for oneself to focus on familiarization with the words and meaning of scripture, there were no primary motivations other than these that were either non-virtuous or neutral. The reason for this can be understood from how the harmonious teaching and learning increased progressively until eight years had passed previously. If I were to briefly describe the conduct of the monks residing here from then until the continuation of this teaching and learning: In general, one must follow the tradition of the venerable Sakyapa masters, the lords of the snow land's doctrine, regarding:
1. The lineage of blessings
2. The ultimate view
3. The conventional philosophical tenets  
4. The method of commenting on scripture
5. All practices of explanation and accomplishment

In particular, one must diligently accomplish the teaching and learning of the piṭakas and rely on the practices as performed by:
1. The two lords of scholars - Yak and Rong
2. The lord of wisdom Drakpa Zangpo
3. His chief son, my teacher, the lord of speech Sangye Pel

The meaning of these instructions appears to indicate in brief the circumstances of establishing this monastic college - under whose patronage, at what time, in what place, and for what purpose - along with the training guidelines. From then until Thubten Namgyal took charge, he made Serling his base and taught between terms at Mekar, Gawa Tshal, Drakmar Chödé, Jamchen and other places, making the teaching and learning extremely refined while also composing many treatises.

The monastic college flourished like a summer lake. At that time, in a dream, he saw what appeared to be the mountain behind Sakya being destroyed and becoming empty. When he made great effort saying "This must be restored," many helpers were also present. When it was restored, there appeared a vision of it being successfully repaired, and it was said that this seemed to bring some benefit to the Sakya teachings. This was certainly a sign that he would restore the Sakya teachings from their foundation and make them shine brilliantly. 

In his 39th year, the Female Fire Pig year called "All-Subduing," he met with Master Khedrub Dönyö Pelwa and his disciples at Drakmar Chödé during the teaching break. From his words: "You must lead our monastery. You should hold both this and Zelung together." Though this instruction came very forcefully, he merely said he would consider what was appropriate but did not actually accept. He taught the Three Vows, Rigs Gter, and Prajñāpāramitā to his monks.

In his 40th year, the Male Earth Mouse year called "All-Holding," he went to Mu with about twenty disciples. From Sempa Chenpo, he received the root empowerment of Hevajra and several profound instructions. Since Lord Dönyö Pelwa had given such instructions, he requested advice on what would be appropriate. After contemplating for about two days, [Sempa Chenpo] said, "You are a geshe who needs to rely on someone like Dönyö Pelwa, so establish a separate monastic college."

When asked what to consider regarding focusing solely on teaching scriptures for a while, [Sempa Chenpo] replied, "Take Sakya Paṇḍita and Butön Rinpoche as examples and establish firm foundations in teaching both sūtra and tantra. " Accepting this advice, [Gorampa] returned to Serling and devoted himself intensively to teaching and study. However, some who were solely focused on their own ease, having labeled themselves as holders of philosophical tenets, became hostile. In the past at this Tanak, at Jetshang there was a highly flourishing center for teaching Vinaya. The great translator Goes Sönam Tsemo invited Lord Atiśa, Lord Gayadhara, and others, and they established traditions of teaching Guhyasamāja and other texts. Several vajra holders who maintained these traditions came. Shortly after, in the upper region came Jatön Senge Zangpo, in the middle region came Taphuk Gyaltsha Bumme, and in the lower region came Chegom Dorje Sherab and others—many excellent holders of the Sakyapa teaching traditions including the Speech Lineage [Lamdré]. At Selung Monastery, the explanatory and practice traditions of the Sakyapa flourished greatly. At that time, the lord of wisdom Sakya Paṇḍita came to Tanak. He scattered flowers of praise upon the great drum of the hillside. He showered an abundant rain of excellent teachings at Rikhud, Taphuk, Selung Monastery, and other places. When the Sakya teachings had declined in this region, he made an aspiration: "May I or someone like me restore them. " It is certain that he made this aspiration, and Drubtob Yönten Pel, who was among the two groups of accomplished ones who maintained the stream of his realization, engaged in practice for a long time and also taught and studied as appropriate.

Not long after that, Lord Dharma, the holy master Sönam Gyaltsen, built many monasteries with fortresses and established many supports for body, speech, and mind. For the benefit and happiness of the region, he concealed many treasures and made it endowed with auspicious glory. His disciples, including the great Muchen Namkha'i Naljor and Drangpo Lungpa Ananda, spread the sacred tradition of Zhijé Dampa Gar and the tradition of Negu and others of the Shangpa Duguwa. Although some yogis who relied on these various traditions appeared, later these traditions declined and were completely overtaken by adherents of other philosophical schools. Although they attempted to obstruct the establishment of the monastic college through various means including threatening with power, through the blessings of the lamas who held the reflection of the Buddha's human form, through the power of the ḍākinīs and dharma protectors who served like servants, and through the lion's roar of King Döndrub Dorjé and his ministers proclaimed more than once, [the opponents] were unable to succeed and lived miserably on food of discontent. At that time, according to the words of the omniscient Namsöd Chenmo: "Last year in my dream, there was a very large encampment at the base of the fifth cliff of Tanak. When asked whose encampment it was, someone said it was the encampment of Sakya Gurgön. I thought this might refer to the incarnate lama becoming the master of Rikhud last year, but now it seems to refer to Gorampa's establishment of this monastic college. That college up there will become unrivaled."

Having heard the prophecy that "A peerless monastic college will emerge up there. Now, since a Sakya teaching lineage will arise here at Tanak, this is excellent," he scattered drops of prophetic nectar.

Although those undisciplined ones could not find direct fault, due to their ill intentions, they manifestly performed some tantric curse-wheels. When signs of this appeared at the monastic college while [Gorampa] was residing at Gawa Tshal, he established praises to Lord Grags pa in the assembly and performed recitations, thus achieving complete victory over the battle of obstacles.

Furthermore, when he became very ill due to others' evil mantras and black magic, Lord Sempa Chenpo came to perform protective rituals. When the master himself performed the main and auxiliary protection practices through the approach of Vajra Dragdzongma, the dharma protectors appeared directly and dispelled all basis for downfall.

At that time, he composed a praise to Mahākāla called "The Great Drum of Victory," crushing opponents to dust and establishing firm foundations for teaching and study. All auspicious connections naturally fell into place.

When a Kachu scholar named Tenpa Rabsel from Samdrup Tse came to request instruction regarding monastic discipline in the evening, [Gorampa] thought he had come earlier. A black man with a conch-shell earring appeared, seemingly about to speak at length, but [Gorampa] said "Now he's gone." Also, when no one else was present, there would often be sounds of two or three people in discussion. When going to look, they would disappear with a sound - even the regular residents like Ahö Zhönnu Zangpo and others would hear this.

Once when he fell ill at Serling, many healing rituals were performed including torma offerings and scripture recitations. At that time, the Shelkar Kachu scholar Sangye saw in a dream two atsaras with conch-shell earrings holding iron hammers in a cave. When asked what they were doing, they said they were performing healing rituals for Gobo Rabjampa. This was certainly an omen, as his health improved immediately.

Whenever such signs of obstacles appeared, by performing torma offerings for several days he would achieve victory over negative forces. All his disciples unanimously stated that the dharma protectors were inseparable from him like a body and its shadow, accomplishing whatever activities were commanded.

Once when he went to teach at Jamchen during a break, he met Rabjam Chöjé and his disciples at Gawa Dong at the boundary of Gephel Namse. [Rabjam Chöjé] was very pleased with the establishment of teaching and study, gave excellent teachings on Srachen, and said these should be continued. He composed special verses of praise, cherishing [Gorampa] as unique among all teachers and blessing him.

When composing the Great General Exposition on Valid Cognition [Tshad ma spyi don chen mo], in a dream he was together with a lama called Lhoring, and while they were melodiously reciting the praise "Non-conceptual," the glorious four-faced Mahākāla appeared. The whole world became tumultuous, and all valleys were filled with brilliant light and the sound of music. Amidst many dancing black-faced warriors wearing strong armor, [Mahākāla appeared] wearing iron boots and leather knee protectors on his two feet. From his knees down, he was about three stories tall, and above that one could not look. He said, "Since we are the lords of your treatise, compose it to completion." This dream was a definitive sign of being accepted by the dharma protectors and accomplishing their activities.

Then, when he was forty-three, in the Iron Female Hare year, while Dharma King Döndrub Dorjé and his ministers were residing at the guesthouse of Shang, they invited the master and showed him even greater worldly respect than before, such as moving his seat. They bestowed incomparable kindness by establishing summer and winter provisions for two hundred monks each, recording them in ledgers, and so forth. At that time, Rangjönpa, Rinchen Tsewa, and Urgyan Dzongpa began creating discord. In spring of the Dragon year, by order of the rulers, they were reprimanded. The rulers went to Tanak. At that time, Rinchen Tsewa's monastery's abbot Paljor Gyaltsen offered his own fortress estate to the district administrator. Although there was a good decree that all monastery offerings and estates should remain in their original state, they began deceiving the northern region of the monastery grounds and attempted to hand it over to Master Dönphakpa. When this plan did not succeed, the rulers sent troops, causing the abbot and his disciples to flee to another land. Except for one or two buildings, the monastery was destroyed by troops. The rulers went to Rinchen Tse.

After being invited with an official letter while the master and his disciples were residing at Ngor, they departed. Initially, he stayed at the Zurkhang residence. The next day, he met with the officials. When he went to inspect the monastery that was being offered, except for some piles of earth, there were no wooden structures at all in the assembly hall and other [buildings]. Then, following the officials' command to perform a torma ritual for five days, he did so. At that time, although the officials' initial discussion was about offering the monastery, later the discussion changed to suggesting it would be better to offer it after doing just enough construction for the assembly hall and residence to be inhabitable, so without coming to a clear resolution, the officials departed. The master and disciples went to Serling. Then in the eleventh lunar month, the officials went to Rikhud and invited him, so he went together with the officials. While staying in a residence at Rikhud Monastery, a royal order came from the Kyidrong official scribe. He said, "Now the officials are residing together at Zilnön Peu. According to the ruler's command, in all circumstances - such as when Master Rabjam came from Kham and stayed at Ngor - he made provisions like offering robes to the great Sugata and so forth. Generally, this was to benefit the Buddha's teachings, and specifically, hoping that one genuine lineage holder would emerge who would give vast teachings and study at our domain. Keeping that intention in mind, we have done whatever service we could. ".

Text from your selection that contained piles of wood would not attract flocks of birds. What was needed was a place where one could freely engage in explanation and listening [to teachings]. Although there was such an intention, previously no convenient opportunity for making offerings had arisen. Regarding this matter, although our ruler was constantly engaged in military affairs, he always tried not to harm monasteries and the sangha. However, recently, due to the bad behavior of the monks of Rinchen Tse, a religious institution was destroyed, which caused great remorse. Now it needs to be restored. It's not just about having the full number of yellow-robed monks - we need someone who will uphold the teachings through exposition and practice. Therefore, since we are offering that monastery to you, there is no need to repeatedly make requests. You must give your word of acceptance on this single occasion. In response to this request, [Gorampa] spoke at length about how he had received the kindness of the ruler and his sons, in accordance with the royal command. When he said there was no choice but to follow the royal command, the officials were very pleased. Then on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, having conquered the four directions with the four-limbed army and ruling the vast earth as a universal monarch, holding supremely precious the white parasol of the general and specific teachings, through limitless amazing deeds that overcame the pride of the three ancestral kings, Dharma King Döndrub Dorjé was enthroned as the great regent of the Buddha in the Land of Snows, along with an appointment decree.

That day, the great scholar Kachen Shakya Lodrö and Rabjam Gönpo Wangchuk both stood up to give speeches at the dharma assembly. Shakya Lodrö made waves of refutation and proof roll forth from the great ocean of eloquent explanation, while Gönpo Wangchuk displayed lightning-like illusions of subtle reasoning, delighting the minds of all the bright scholars in attendance. The master himself newly named the monastery "Thubten Namgyal" (Complete Victory of the Buddha's Teaching). At that time, after just taking possession of the monastery, he returned to Serling. Although some say that the former religious institution of Rinchen Tse was originally a Gelug monastery, it appears to have been first a branch monastery of Narthang, later becoming predominantly Sakya. This is evident as Jamkar Gyaltsen Drak, a direct disciple of Butön and Chöjé Lama, served as its abbot. He appears to have been a Sakya geshé. After him, Chöjé Ananda served [as abbot]. Initially, he received ripening and liberating instructions from many Narthang geshés. Later, he served as abbot of religious institutions like Drangpo Lung and Rinchen Tse, and also became a lama of many Sakya officials, having a very strong connection with the Sakya tradition, as appears in his own biography. After him, Chöjé Paljor Gyaltsen served as abbot. He too primarily maintained the tradition of the previous two, and appears to have had dharma connections with Je Gendün Drub and others. This has been mentioned as a side note.

Then, when he reached his forty-fifth year, in the second lunar month of the Female Water Snake year called "Victory," he arrived at Thubten Namgyal. He oversaw construction work for various petitioners regarding the main hall and private quarters. To some, he granted most of the old building sites for houses. While the assembly hall initially faced south, he had the intention to make it face east, so he added one pillar row to the east and two pillar rows to the south. He also performed an extensive ground blessing ceremony with a select group of disciples. Then, since there was no established system of study, he focused on construction work, and the monastery gradually developed.

2. Regarding how he spread the teachings through the three approaches of explanation, debate, and composition:
2.1. How his explanations, like divine drums, awakened all beings from the sleep of ignorance
2.2. How his compositions, like sunlight, caused the hundred-petaled lotus garden of the Buddha's teaching to bloom
2.3. How his debates, like vajra wheels, crushed the mountain of wrong views

2.1. First, just as the Victorious Ones manifested the dharmakāya in Akaniṣṭha and then demonstrated the ways of ordination and practicing austerities in Jambudvīpa to ripen and liberate their own minds before benefiting the three types of beings, this holy one too, though having long since manifested enlightenment, again appeared to others demonstrating the methods for ripening and liberating one's mind. His daily dharma activities were as follows: After completing the evening session's yogic sleep practice, he would arise with the early dawn yoga practice. First, he would perform the common and uncommon protection practices of Vīra [Vīrapa].

2.1. Then he would practice the profound guru path and the visualization-recitation of Nāropa's Khecarī. After that, he would perform the expanded time path with the concluding life-force wind yoga and recitation, followed by unfailing recitation of many dhāraṇī mantras such as Vijayā and Bhaiṣajya. At dawn, he would briefly review the major texts to be taught that afternoon. Then, after performing the four white offerings, immediately after completing his meal, he would teach extensively on the root texts of Pramāṇa and any of the later volumes, followed by general meaning commentaries, Thalphrengsdu and other teachings suitable to each student's capacity. Afterward, he would teach various tantric teachings including tantras and oral instructions, followed by the midday session and meal. Immediately after the midday meal, for general teachings he would teach whatever was appropriate from Vinaya, Bodhicaryāvatāra, Śikṣāsamuccaya, mind training, and others, along with abbreviated Pramāṇa texts, any of the later volumes, and general meaning commentaries as in the morning teachings. Then he would teach one of the very profound Vajrayāna teachings. Then he would go inside, and from the time of the dharma activity gaṇḍī until evening, he would focus single-pointedly on his personal practice: first the expanded time path, then the two systems of Kṛṣṇa Cakrasaṃvara and Ghaṇṭāpāda, five-deity Yamāntaka, very unelaborate yoga, profound guru path yoga, Nāropa's Khecarī and other visualization-recitations extensively. After that, he would perform the extensive torma offering and dedication to yidams and dharma protectors, then perform the two protection practices of Vīrapa.

After that, he would enter single-pointedly into the clear light of sleep yoga. Then, performing the rising yoga and others as mentioned before, he never let his three doors remain ordinary in any situation. In the place of dharma retreat, in addition to his previous practices, he would continuously perform empowerments, authorizations, consecrations, fire offerings, composition of treatises, tantra explanations, and giving instructions. Regarding the types of empowerments he gave:

1. Four transmissions of Hevajra
2. Fifteen deities of Nairātmyā
3. Two systems of Guhyasamāja
4. Three lineages of Guhyasamāja
5. Two systems of Cakrasaṃvara (Lūipa and Ḍrīlapa)
6. Ocean of Ḍākinīs
7. Earth tradition of Yamāntaka
8. Five-deity Red Yamāri
9. Seventeen-deity Tārā
10. Earth tradition of Sarvavid
11. Nine deities of Amitāyus
12. Death-conquering Vajrapāṇi
13. General empowerment of the three families
14. Five deities of Arapacana and countless others

The authorization transmissions exceeded hundreds of sādhanas. Regarding the types of scriptural teachings he gave:

1. Verse Summary of Precious Qualities
2. Abhisamayālaṅkāra with commentary Sphuṭārtha
3. Four later works of Maitreya
4. Higher and Lower Abhidharma
5. Five Collections of Reasoning (Madhyamaka)
6. Śataka
7. Madhyamakāvatāra
8. Bodhicaryāvatāra
9. Vinaya Sūtra
10. Pramāṇavārttika
11. Pramāṇaviniścaya
12. Three Vows

He would teach these very extensively from memory along with their respective commentaries and general meaning texts. His teaching through mere scriptural transmission included innumerable texts such as the Bodhisattvabhūmi, Śikṣāsamuccaya, and the two Collections of Sayings. Furthermore, he was especially skilled in Prajñāpāramitā.

During the time when the Tathāgata taught the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras, he was declared to be one of the main figures of Kālacakra. Once in the dharma court, after giving a very extensive explanation of three ways of applying the opening homage of Abhisamayālaṅkāra, he directly stated, "I wonder if such a scholar was one of the assembly members when Buddha taught the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras in the past. Actually, there's no reason to say they weren't. " This is found in his biography written by Boldrongpa Rigpé Wangchuk, who heard this himself. Regarding the types of textual explanations he gave previously:
1. Hevajratantra with Nairātmyā
2. Guhyasamāja with ornaments
3. Sambhūṭi with essential clarifications
4. Cakrasaṃvara root tantra from Muktikāvalī
5. From Jetsün's commentary on Caryā
6. From Sachen's commentary on Seven Points of Realization
7. From Guhyasamāja root tantra with Pradīpoddyotana commentary and Butön's Clear Explanation of Six Extremes
8. From his own commentary on Purification Tantra, teaching thoroughly and repeatedly from memory

As for mere scriptural transmission teachings, he taught countless texts including the Indian texts of the three cycles of Saṃvara, Hevajra, and Guhyasamāja. He stayed primarily at Thubten Serling for five years after Thubten Monastery, and gave periodic teachings at Dokhar. At the end of that year, Trophu Chöjé Sanggyé Darwé offered a monastic tea service, and the general residence offered another tea service, making three tea services daily, while he conducted extensive prayer sessions.

At one time, when Chöjé Künga Wangchuk had not yet gone to Ngari, he came to meet [Gorampa] at a mountain retreat. Previously, when he requested the authorization of Nyengön from the Mahāsattva, [Gorampa] said, "I have never performed this ritual before," and a brown-colored dog appeared at Khaur Gön's face. Since the regular six-armed torma dedication done at Khaur became rough, from then on it became more refined. Remembering the prophecy that said "The lineage of Nyengön itself belongs to the current holder of E-waṃ monastery," he requested the Nyengön authorization. The Lord replied, "Master teacher, your mind is coarse. How could this be possible at this place where Sakya and Gelug are mixed?" Before he could finish speaking, a very large and majestic black bird landed on the roof, followed immediately by the roof being covered with black birds. Regarding the prophetic signs, since it was both the eighth and twenty-third day of the waning moon, and there was also the Mahāsattva's prophecy, [the Lord] said "Since you have pure view and tenets, it seems appropriate," and gave [the authorization]. At the end of his instructions, he said "May this increase your [realization of the] Three Jewels." The next day, he accompanied him to the river. At that time, he gave him a large pill of Ārya amṛta and said "Be diligent in teaching and studying."

When they were about to return, when [Künga Wangchuk] said "Let's put the small monks in the center and have the large monks surround them like an umbrella," and arranged them that way, he asked "Wouldn't it be more beautiful if the large ones surrounded the small ones?" [The Lord] replied, "That would also work."

Having done so likewise, he departed after giving the prophecy that said "You must maintain with great diligence the view and tenets of the previous masters and focus on the monasteries. "

These compositions are well-crafted with pleasing language, profound and vast in meaning. When thoroughly examined by scholars who have studied extensively, their qualities become increasingly clear, and one gains deep certainty that cannot be exhausted by intellectual analysis. They are not mere repetitions of other traditions or beyond scholarly examination. Rather, they consistently received blessed appearances from the pleased gurus, yidam deities, ḍākinīs and dharma protectors. As the Lord himself said: "For whatever composition I wrote, there was never a time without some special dream occurring, except when composing the 'Dispelling Confusion About the Three Vows' - I wonder why that was."

3. How the Vajra Wheel of Debate Crushed the Mountain of Wrong Views:

In general, debate refers to when proponent, respondent, and judge directly engage in a formal setting, each maintaining their philosophical positions and establishing reasons for the victory of the teaching through exchanges of scripture and logic. In Noble India, when inconceivable wrong views and practices arose, the great charioteers like Nāgārjuna thoroughly refuted them and made the Buddha's teaching even more luminous. Here in the Land of Snows as well, when many wrong views appeared early and later, first the translator Rinchen Zangpo and

Having defeated Go Khugpa Lhatsé and others, later the Second Omniscient One took twenty-five successive rebirths as paṇḍitas like Vasubandhu. The great Sakya Paṇḍita thoroughly refuted [wrong views] and made the Victor's teaching clear. Following that, when some wrong views arose again, masters like Dorje Chang Kunga Zangpo, who took fourteen successive rebirths as paṇḍitas like Śyāna Candra, also properly refuted them and made the precious Sakya forebears' tradition even clearer. Following that, this great being also performed activities to benefit the teaching through debate, in the manner of Dharmakīrti. The way he directly engaged in debate with opponents was as mentioned before. Furthermore, regarding how he defeated proponents of wrong views: While the great Mādhyamikas of Noble India were certain about the two distinct philosophical tenets of Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika regarding conventional presentations, and although masters like Atiśa and Śāntipa disagreed with both Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika in some ways, they had no disagreement regarding the ultimate view. Here in the Land of Snow, some claim that since the imagined and dependent natures are conventional truth, they are empty of inherent nature or unestablished as truly existent, while the thoroughly established nature as ultimate truth is empty in relation to other conventional phenomena but is not empty from the perspective of its own nature or is truly established, thus speaking of eternalism. They newly labeled this as "Other-Empty Madhyamaka."

When later scholars claimed: "The view of freedom from the four extremes is the Chinese Heshang's view of non-analysis, while the ultimate Madhyamaka view is clinging to emptiness after refuting truth through reasoning. This was also Nāgārjuna and his spiritual sons' intent, and it is the view prophesied by the yidam deities." Many scholars and non-scholars followed this like rabbits following tracks. When their senseless babbling prevented others from being heard, he composed "Moonbeams on the Essential Points of the Supreme Vehicle" that thoroughly refuted them through scripture and reasoning, making the authentic tradition clear. Furthermore, to train in the extremely profound essential points of that same text, he composed "The Sword of Reasoning: Destroying Wrong Views About Vajrayāna," which cut to pieces the throats of wrong speakers through the sharp weapon of reasoning arising from the power of things themselves, thereby clarifying the essential meaning. Although some lacked the ability to understand the tantras and excellent treatises of siddhas correctly, due to their pride in their family lineage and physical strength, they wrongly argued against the "Moonbeams on Essential Points." He composed "Illuminator of Essential Points" to refute their wrong statements and establish the former [view] correctly. Furthermore, when some arduously composed a text called "Ocean of Suchness," he composed "Destroyer of Harm to Others' Benefit" which properly refuted through scripture and reasoning their analysis and criticism of "Rays of Light Benefiting Others," thereby establishing them in an undefeatable position in the battlefield of debate.

Under the guise of questions, when some emerged who were hostile to and focused on refuting the intended meaning of the words of the Mañjunātha Guru's textual tradition, this great intellect defeated them one by one. He composed treatises like "Dispelling Confusion about the Three Vows" and its supplement that clearly presented the intended meaning of the earlier masters exactly as it was. He cleansed with pure water of scripture and reasoning the wish-fulfilling jewel of the earlier masters' textual tradition that had been blackened by the stains of wrong thinking. He raised the supreme victory banner of exposition and practice to its peak, uniquely satisfying endless fortunate beings generation after generation with the desired excellent teachings of the Sakyapas. If this was not the kindness of this lord of speakers alone, who else could it possibly be from?

All these treatises were composed only after receiving permission from the guru and special deities. When the supplement to the Three Vows remained incomplete for a long time after its beginning, in a dream the Lord Mahāsattva urged with a great voice: "Do not be negligent in cleaning up the doctrine. " When he asked the four-faced Mahākāla who appeared displeased what was wrong, he dreamed that he said "You are not completing the treatise. " Based on these dreams he completed the composition, which shows [their influence]. Then at one time, due to someone's wrong practice, he became somewhat discouraged and wondered how long he would live.

In Lhartse, there is currently a main temple building. Thinking that a residence should be established here to focus primarily on spiritual practice, the officials gathered at Rinchen Peak. At that time, he also made a commitment to Official Yungpa to teach and study sūtra and tantra for about thirteen years, saying: "You officials are the ones who granted me this monastery. I intend to focus on recitation practice, so now you officials must accept the offering calculations. " When he said this, Official Yungpa prostrated and said: "Although we worldly people may not recognize greatness, in general, those who abandon working for the doctrine and beings, and primarily practice mental stabilization for their own sake - this mental stability is difficult to arise in those who have analytical understanding preceded by study and contemplation, while it is said to arise easily in old practitioners like cow herders who lack analytical understanding. Furthermore, regarding this nature of mind, rather than relying on those skilled in maintaining vows, it seems there might be quick realization when depending on the obscuring circumstances of ignorant householders in mountain valleys and playful vagrants. Other than having such doubts, what else could it be? In particular, in former times, though Buton, Khache, Lama Dampa, and Gyalse Thogmepa were equally learned, Buton and Lama Dampa taught, while Gyalse focused on meditation. These days, there are many who claim to maintain the enlightened activities of Buton and Lama Dampa. ".

Those who follow the lineage of Gyalsepa only do a little practice and teaching of mind training [blo sbyong], without maintaining a great continuity of enlightened activity. Although Gyalsepa focused on meditation and attained liberation, when someone asked "Did those two (Buton and Lama Dampa) not go to lower realms by focusing on teaching and studying?", this deeply touched his heart. In a dream, he was in what seemed to be a cave at Kyedlha rock with several teachers and students. There were also two monkey children there. When someone said "These must be emanations of the four-faced Mahākāla," they both smiled. Then when he asked "Since you are the Wisdom Protector, which do you prefer for the end of my life - single-pointed practice or single-pointed teaching?", he dreamed that they both nodded their heads and closed their eyes saying "Practice, practice. " Once while staying at Sakya, Putadung actually appeared before him with a conch shell. When he asked "For the end of my life, is it better to practice or teach?", based on the reply that teaching would benefit the doctrine more, he said he would dedicate his entire life to teaching and studying. In his fiftieth year, the Earth Male Dog year, he decided to go to the great seat of glorious Sakya for the summer teaching session. He established a fifteen-day Dharma session at Dokhar. Taking provisions for half the period, he departed on the ninth and spent some days at Shab Med. At that time, all the teachers and students received the blessing empowerment of Mañjughoṣa Arapacana from Master Dagchen Chumigpa Lodrö Wangchuk.

He received the transmission of the Tub Ten Serkhang. That evening he went to the Khro Temple, offered butter lamps and made extensive prayers. While staying in the Image Temple, he recited the Maitreya Maṇḍala text about eleven times. When he dozed off slightly, in a dream he had a vision of Lord Maitreya who said: "The sequence of the four paths is correct and the meaning is good, but the result is missing." To the earlier composition, after "Having donned the armor of practicing the six perfections" indicates the Path of Accumulation; "Through clear experience of the correct view" indicates the Path of Preparation; "Having actualized the naturally pure mode of being" indicates the Path of Seeing; "Blessed to meditate in order to abandon habitual tendencies" indicates the Path of Meditation. Later, to add the result at the end, he added one verse beginning with "In the dharmadhātu sky free from the clouds of the two obscurations." This was a genuine sign of being blessed and cared for by Lord Maitreya. The next morning he arose early and spent one day each at Zhalkar Lhadong and Zhonga. Around noon on the thirteenth, he arrived near the great Tuṣita of the Land of Snow where emanations of the Three Protectors continuously appear - the glorious Sakya. At that time, many elders led by Administrator Jampa Senge came to welcome him. While they were offering prostrations, since it was a major monastery, as instructed he dismounted at the horse steps, along with the three types of teachers and students. When he first saw the great temple...

When he first saw the great temple, all the teachers and students prostrated themselves on the ground. At that time, due to his vast fame, all the monks in that area discussed how this master was truly an emanation of Venerable Grags pa rgyal mtshan. Although there was such a crowd of people seeking blessings that one could hardly escape, by joining hands with the monks who had gone ahead, everyone received blessings without any harm coming to him. He took up residence in the eastern Labrang. The next day, on the fourteenth, during the memorial service for Sakya Paṇḍita, he offered excellent tea to about two thousand monks, giving each monk one ka dan and one kha do. He made vast offerings including inconceivable arrays of butter lamps in each of the pure temples to the various masters including the hundreds-chiefs. He made extensive offerings and received teachings from the Lord of Power, the Great Master Gyagar Sherab Gyaltsen. After offering provisions according to the common custom to the attendants of Lhasa Dzong and the Great Temple, he established two dharma sessions. During that period, while maintaining detachment, about thirty select teacher-student pairs from among the wealthy of that community were invited twice daily, morning and afternoon. Since there were many invitations, whatever butter came was offered as butter lamps. The monks also offered many butter lamps, and it is said that later that year the butter lamps were especially good and from then on the tradition of butter lamp offerings continued to improve.

While visiting famous shrine rooms such as Gorum, he made continuous offerings of banners and tormas, and made aspiration prayers. During the breaks between teachings, he was invited for water offerings. There were also abundant offerings of barley and other items. He bestowed the Madhyamaka bodhisattva vows to all people, both ordained and lay, high and low. To a select group including Master Sangye Gyatsoba, he granted the empowerment of the Five-Deity Yamāntaka, the Yamāntaka empowerment in the Sa tradition, and many other transmissions to their satisfaction. Then he went to Kha'ur. He met with Lord Lodro Gyaltsen who was in retreat at Phagpa Cave. They had many discussions on both spiritual and temporal matters, and he received the transmissions of Dugyel and Karmo Da. That night when he performed torma ritual in the shrine room, an arrow banner fell near him. When he reported this to the Lord, he said it was a sign of siddhis being granted by Mahākāla and that he should keep it. As instructed, he exchanged it for a fine black silk banner and placed it among the hanging banners. At that time, Gyalrangwa Wonpo Namkha Nyingpo directly observed that a crystal heart brought from India by Nyenlo showed great devotion to this master. The caretaker dreamed that the Great Mother and Four Sisters welcomed him at a bridge. Once, when this master was alone in front of the leather mask, the caretaker heard him having a direct conversation with the leather mask.

At that time, from the writings of the Great Master [Bdag chen], regarding the meaning of the first verse with many symbolic words that appears in the outline section of Stong thun [Empty of Essence], which states "The unsurpassed direction is that which transforms divisions, endowed with eyes. " - although there were many interpretations of this, since there had not been previous explanations of the symbolism of the remaining verses, when asked if there might be an error in understanding, he replied that there had been no mistake in the previous understanding. When he went to Sakya, the statue of the Venerable One built by Naro Paṇḍita Yamāntaka Grags was invited to the eastern Labrang. After making extensive offerings for seven days and making prayers, one day he said it had spontaneously arisen in his mind, and he composed the work called "Bestower of Glory of Definitive Symbolic Interpretation" [brda 'grol nges pa'i dpal ster]. This was because it appeared in "Recollection of Previous Lives" that he was accepted as being the actual incarnation of the Precious Venerable Grags pa, continuing the succession of physical incarnations. As mentioned before, regarding the dream of the Great Maitreya incarnation and the words of Master Lodrö Gyaltsen who said, "Last year in my dream, I saw someone who claimed to be Venerable Grags pa's empowerment vase moving back and forth many times in the sky above the central street of Sakya. This seems to refer to the Geshe Rabjampa who is coming to teach at Sakya this year" - these also support this connection. At that time at Gorum, in front of the statue and residence of the Precious Venerable Grags pa, he created a colored sand maṇḍala and bestowed the condensed empowerment of Kīla in the oral instruction tradition. Lord Lhachok Senge entered the door of the teachings under him and was given the name Lhachok Senge. His two practice companions were named Luchok Senge and Michok Senge, and it appears their activities later became very extensive.

Having heard the Hevajra empowerment from Lhachok Senge at that time, he requested the secret name Pal Thukyi Dorje that was given during the Vairocana name empowerment when he previously received the Kīla empowerment from Dagchen Lodrö Gyaltsen. [The master] asked if he had received an empowerment before. When the reason was explained, [he said] "Although it is wonderful that you have received the father teaching of the Sakya lineage holders, since something like this has been needed since Khön Könchok Gyalpo, I will begin your ripening empowerment from today," and joyfully gave him the secret name Palkyi Dorje. That night, after giving the authorization of the Three Deity Family in front of the leather mask, when he gave commands in a loud voice, it is said there was an extremely powerful radiance. It appears that nurturing such disciples in this way was done with the intention that it would greatly benefit the teachings later. He gave everyone, both lay and ordained: the mind training instruction on the Four Separations from Attachment, the reading transmission of Thubpa Gongsal, the authorization of Paṇ Śāvaripa, and so forth. In short, all the lay and ordained people of the great monastery developed genuine recognition of him as the actual Buddha. Empowerments, authorizations, full ordinations, lay vows, abstaining from killing, commitments to the Six-Syllable mantra, and even protection cords and blessed water accomplished immeasurable benefit for beings, which made him very pleased. The lord of scholars, Musradpa Dorje Gyaltsen, along with the hundred-chief of Drangmoche, invited him to the Labrang and Drangmoche. They made excellent offerings and services, and there was extensive pleasant conversation.

Then, on the morning of the fifteenth day of the Miracle Month, in front of the radiant Mañjuśrī, he bestowed the Madhyamaka bodhisattva vows and extensive aspiration prayers to all the gathered people. In the evening, he also gave the authorization of orange-yellow Mañjuśrī to the monks who were attending the prayer session. Although it was an extremely cold winter time, all rivers and streams melted as if it were spring. The Kha'u River became very full, and the meditation water of Stag Bodhisattva, which had dried up, newly sprung forth. Just as prophesied in the lord's words: "From now for three years, this four-cornered day-path of Sakya will have pure earth, good harvests, and no need for boats," it came to pass exactly as foretold. Later, he also said: "From then on, this monastic college continued to grow increasingly, and even I experienced very few obstacles such as illness. " Thus, he established firm roots for immeasurable temporary and ultimate benefits. Then departing on the seventeenth, he stayed in Lhasa that night. The next day he went to Dong-ngar. Being invited by Tashi Dzom, he had many pleasant conversations with an excellent Geshe named Dharma Lord Pallegpa, who was an attendant of the Great Dharma King of Mahāyāna. The next day, he was invited for lunch at Zhichen, where he made prayers before the statue of Precious Phagpa. That evening, he went to Dega Lhaden. When the monks of this place, including Dharma Lord Sönam Gönpo, made a request for teachings, he gave a ten-day teaching.

He also established teachings there. Having been invited by Mangkar Samdrup with Venerable Gedenpo, he stayed for two days. Traveling to Mugulung, he made extensive butter lamp offerings and prayers before the statue of Drogmi Lotsāwa. Then, invited by Mdarpa Nangpo, he bestowed full ordination to an abbot of the monastery who was a representative of Mdarpa, and to a Dharma official from Zurtso. The next day, a select group of teachers and students were invited to Tshopho and Lhatse, where he performed extensive prayers, torma offerings, and observations of the sacred objects and protector temples established by Precious Phagpa. The following day, he went to Sagthang Ding, where he made extensive offerings and prayers at Zhang Gönpawa's reliquary stupa. The next day he went to Jonang Mdar, where he paid homage to the inner sacred objects and circumambulated with those who had not attended Jonang. Then he gradually proceeded to Thubten Namgyal. At that time, the local people requested: "Just as you bestowed bodhisattva vows at Sakya, please grant them to us as well." In response, from the Trisamvara Dharma throne, he properly gave the extensive Madhyamaka bodhisattva vows to all the gathered people, along with auspicious aspiration prayers for both immediate and long-term benefit. At the end of that year, when invited by the patron Chökyong Bö Thro, the teachings and prayers increased like competing waves. From then on for many years, Chökyong Bö, Thromda, and the ten siblings including Singyong Kachupa Sönam Gyaltsen and others offered favorable conditions and stayed to practice Dharma.

During his stay at Shap, patrons offered favorable conditions and made aspirations at Throphu. When some important patrons from Shap along with several lamas mentioned that this place was very rough and no lama who had come here could establish a meditation retreat site, and that it would not be good to establish one now either, he replied there would be no problem. He then established a retreat site in a large plain below the master's residence. Not long after the retreat site was established, at the previous meditation site, there appeared countless voices speaking of invisible rabbit horns, sounds, pillars and such. When he contemplated what this might be, he realized it was magical manifestations of the Eight Classes of Spirits. With great compassion arising in his heart, he offered countless body-offerings and remained in meditation on the view for a long time, which led to experiences of bliss and smoothness. That night, someone with clairvoyance in that region saw all the local deities and spirits each carrying away an image of the master's form. According to the master's words, he said he had never found a more beneficial practice than this Chöd instruction. In the Iron Female Ox year when he was fifty-three, for the commemoration of Dagchen Chumigpa Lodrö Wangchuk's passing to another realm, with the three monastic assemblies of Ngorpa Thubten, Sermogchen present, and with the great scholar-adept Palden Dorje as abbot and a qualified disciple of Panchen Shakya Chogden as action-master, the master acted as secret preceptor and gave full ordination to many including a representative of Tanag Drolmawa. He was given a name incorporating parts of all three preceptors' names and was called Sönam Palchog.

Then he went to Ewam, where with Khenpo Khédrup Palden Dorje as abbot and Master Sönam Sangye as action-master, he performed full ordination for Yongdzin Könchok Pel and others, after which he returned to Thubten.

4. Regarding how he received empowerment as regent of the Buddha and how he engaged in teaching and learning primarily focused on the tantras:

There are two parts regarding how he maintained activities after becoming the throne-holder of Ewam and how he completed activities after returning to Thubten:

1. First: In the Male Water Tiger year when he was fifty-four, after the Ngor representatives arrived at Thubten Namgyal, they earnestly requested him to serve as abbot, or at least as acting abbot for one or two years to give the Lamdré and other teachings. The master thought that since Thubten Namgyal needed a flourishing monastic assembly and continuous teaching of sutra and tantra, going to Ewam would harm this. However, he felt the master's monastery must have someone to maintain it. Moreover, since Lord Vajradhara had arranged auspicious connections by giving him the conch shell as an empowerment article, and when the great being, the holy regent, came from Ngari, a holy tutor who was still young and had come to meet him on the way to Mustang said, "Your nephew here will become someone important in the future, so he must be sent to study. First, he needs to study the sutras."

4. Regarding how he received empowerment as regent of the Buddha and how he engaged in teaching and learning primarily focused on the tantras:

Since he upholds the unique tenets of the Sakyapa tradition, his view and philosophical position are pure. Since Gobo Rabjampa had exceptional faith in the master himself, he needed to be sent to Tanag. Although there weren't many monks at present, the teaching and learning were excellent. In the future, it would be greatly beneficial for all of us, teachers and students. He said he would also send his two nephews. When Jamyang Sherab Tsho came to meet him in the lower residence, for the sake of auspicious connection, he gave him three measures of white cotton cloth, a bowl of nutmeg, and whatever else was offered. Without being requested, he gave the transmission of his own composition "Waves of Faith" and said "This transmission lineage will be needed by you in the future. " When the holy regent was about to depart for Ngari, he said "Keep a watchful eye on the previous masters' philosophical views and the monasteries. " When Khédrup Palden Dorje arrived at Sakya and requested advice about the monastic seat, he remembered all these things - that there shouldn't be too many circumambulations to the right or left, and that he should request teachings from Gobo Rabjampa. He thought whether this might be an appropriate time. This year he would teach Dharma. Since the patron of Mustang Ngorpa was the main benefactor, he said to send him to discuss this. Implicit agreement was reached. At that time, when some monks requested him further, saying it would be good to do something like another round of visits, he said "Who would we rely on? Even Ngorpa is going through difficult times. If I don't accept that young nephew, he won't come. If we need to rely on someone, it should be the master and his spiritual sons, whose kindness can never be repaid no matter what. " Having said this, he decided to go.

At Labrang, Gendün Zangpo served as the offering master, and for the position of Dharma master, there were three teacher-students. Tshultrim Zangpo was appointed as representative. After giving detailed instructions as needed, from the intermediate dharma session at this master's Dokhar, he proceeded to Ewam via Shap Valley. In that Tiger year, serving as abbot, he extensively performed the secret dharma teachings according to the traditions of the previous masters including the Lamdré, full ordination ceremonies, and elaborate ritual offerings commemorating Vajradhara. Then he returned to Thubten. At the end of that year, when the Ngorpa officials and their representatives came to Thubten and requested him to serve as the throne-holder, flowers fell like snow, amazinga everyone. After giving instructions regarding the arrangements for beginning the first winter teachings, that night in a dream, he was teaching Dharma to many people from atop a great throne. At the four corners of that throne were Nāgārjuna, Āryadeva, Vasubandhu and Dignāga, who in sequence proclaimed: "We prostrate to the supreme precious mountain of instructions, dwelling in the center of the ocean of merit, the lion's throne of excellent explanations, the lord of mountains of qualities." When he awoke, he said this was a very auspicious connection and that very day he joined the assembly.

Then with great joy he proceeded to Ewam. On the fifth day of the first month in the Female Water Hare year, at age 55 (called Mdzespyed), he was enthroned as the supreme regent of the Buddha upon the vast throne with wheel-marked footprints - he who was the crown jewel of all the scholars of Khawa Ripa, the treasury of ripening and liberation of the entire Vajrayāna, following in the footsteps of Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo of this degenerate age. Amidst the shower of flower petals from gods and humans who delight in virtue, and auspicious songs from the gathered assembly, he was installed as the supreme regent of the Buddha and received the excellent approval of all the Buddhas. At that time, Dharma King Dondrub Dorje and other great and minor patrons, monasteries from various directions, and the lamas, teachers, and renowned and lesser monks of Ewam itself made offering celebrations that fell like rain. From then until the Male Fire Horse year, for four years, he established countless fortunate disciples equal to the particles of the earth-holder on the path to liberation and enlightenment through: the footsteps of countless lords of accomplishment; the gateway traversed by scholars; the precious oral instructions of the Lamdré with its resultant teachings that were transmitted to the venerable Sakyapa father and son, which became the vessel for the discriminating wisdom of Virūpa, lord of accomplishment who is the nectar from the mouth of Venerable Vajrayoginī; empowerments, authorizations, transmissions and instructions connected with the four classes of tantra; and as support for those, inconceivable ripening and liberating instructions including explanations of tantras and Indian treatises. He also performed countless full ordinations, which are the root of the teachings.

During those occasions, for the six months of winter and spring he primarily engaged in explaining and studying the Vajrayāna at Ewam Chödhen, while for the six months of summer and autumn he primarily focused on explaining and studying the Tripiṭaka at Thubten Namgyal, thus extensively promoting both general and specific aspects of the teachings.

In a dream concerning the clarification of this matter, someone said "This is creating auspicious connections for vast benefit to others" and gave him what was said to be Venerable Dragpa's sacred water to drink, which transformed into the dhāraṇī of Amitāyus. Additionally, in a dream of the great scholar Sipa Künlo, when this master was seated on the throne at Ewam, Venerable Rinpoche Dragpa Gyaltsen appeared in the space above, saying "This creates auspicious connections for long-lasting benefit to others" and transformed into the form of Amitāyus. Since this accorded with the earlier [dream], it was an excellent sign or prophecy indicating vast and long-lasting virtuous activities.

Thus, his excellent words of fame reached the limits of space. The sprouts of his disciples covered the extent of the wealthy ones. He gained mastery over the treasury of qualities of scriptural learning and realization in space. The continuous path of saṃsāra, which hangs like the embrace of passion due to karma and afflictions, was cut off. The root of permanent happiness was established. His mind was uplifted by accomplishing vast benefit for the teachings and beings.

The guru, tutelary deities, ḍākinīs, and dharma protectors showed their smiling faces more than once and gave words of encouragement, which made him deeply joyful and gave him inexhaustible confidence in benefiting others. When he gave ripening empowerments of the Speech [tantras] to about a thousand assembled disciples in the Dragon year, in a dream eight women appeared in Tibetan dress adorned with various precious ornaments. They recited some verses according to the system of the foundational Pāramitāyāna and some verses according to the system of the foundational Vajrayāna, then dissolved into the powder maṇḍala. They said that all who received empowerment from this maṇḍala were very fortunate.

Since he was performing four actual empowerments daily, some minor illness manifested and he had to rest. When he dozed off slightly, in the sky towards the east there was a repeated snapping sound. Wondering what it was, he beheld directly the great Sakyapa, whose large and majestic body was like Mount Meru embraced by a hundred thousand suns, smiling and radiating various light rays. From his mouth came the words "Son of the family, do not be negligent in benefiting the teachings and beings." Immediately, he praised him with these words: "Lord of the six realms, Vajradhara; wisdom of all victors, Mañjughoṣa; power of all buddhas, Virūpa - inseparable guru, I take refuge in you." As soon as he finished saying this, [the vision] disappeared like a rainbow.

Then, regarding the wall painting still present at Ewam - it is said that this famous white painting was created, having extremely great blessings. Moreover, at the residence, there were extensive offerings from upper and lower [regions], including forty prayer services with communal tea offerings, and seeing the great necessity of things like continuous butter lamp offerings surrounding the temples, he sent the Kachupa Sangye Gyaltsen and disciples in the Hare year to request offerings from the Dokham region. In their general petition, after reciting a pleasing garland of verses beginning with "Having taken residence in the ocean of all scriptures..." when discussing the matter at hand, [he said]: "Although we have established powerful teaching and study of primarily the Tripiṭaka at Tanag Rinchen Tse Thubten Namgyal monastery, due to the intense insistence of all the monks including the senior Ngorpa teachers and students that I must serve as the throne-holder, I could not refuse. When considering even a fraction of how the lord guru father and son worked for the Buddha's teachings, remembering their unrepayable kindness, although there was no one to take responsibility here in the future, I found no other option and could not abandon it mentally. Thus, I accepted the responsibility of the throne from the fifteenth day of the first month of the Hare year." At the conclusion, [he performed rituals] including the Three Red Ones beginning with "In the center of the crescent moon empowerment maṇḍala..."

Having given orders and assigned tasks to the dharma protectors, in the Horse year there arrived: 350 measures of tea, a full measure of turquoise, 25 horses and mules, many piles of silk cloth offerings, numerous ritual items including maṇḍalas of ivory bone, and others. Furthermore, many items including conch shells with spirals and even numerous bundles of needles and thread - all these arrived as listed in the letters. Again in the Sheep year, when calculating in detail the remaining tea collection areas which yielded fifty measures of tea, over a period of twenty-seven years there was surplus tea for practice offerings and general use. He made a commitment not to give even a single grain as a loan to anyone except for communal tea offerings. For each communal tea offering, five measures of butter were used. On top of whatever religious practices existed before, they had good discussions about instituting the Dad chu ma prayer, the Khyod nyid dam pa prayer, and the Sukhāvatī aspiration prayers composed by the Lord himself. At age 58, in the Male Fire Horse year according to the Mongolian calendar, on the twenty-fifth day of the fourth month of Sa ga zla ba, the flower of the prophecy of the three lamas fell upon Khenchen Konchog Pel, who was renowned as the white banner surpassing the crown of existence, who had become the heart son of the Lord himself. He was installed as the supreme regent while a shower of flowers from gods and humans fell, and an ornate garland of auspicious verses from the assembled gathering led by the Lord himself made the light of excellence shine undiminished until the end of existence.

From then on, he gave detailed instructions to the supreme tutor regarding what needed to be done for the doctrine. All material offerings that fell like rain, he did not keep even a sesame seed for himself, but allocated them to ritual implements for various temples, butter lamps, and repairs. Thus, he was extremely kind to Ewam Chöden both spiritually and materially. The current system of collecting offerings was also established from that time.

After having good discussions about the outer and inner explanations of the Kīla sādhana maṇḍala and the supplements to "The Sunlight Spreading the Teaching of Sacred Speech" [Gsung ngag bstan pa rgyas pa'i nyi 'od], he composed "The Source of Accomplishments" practice guide by Lord Sangye Rinchen. Based on these, Lord Konchog Lhundrup composed practice guides for the preliminary practices and main practice, making these Lamdré instructions with their results accessible like a great path that all could traverse. Know that this was solely due to the kindness of this master of wisdom.

2. How he returned to the Buddhist doctrine and completed enlightened activities: In the Hare year, he was invited by the Bodongpas and went to Bodong. At that time, the assembly of monks was very large. He established monthly dharma sessions. Based on philosophical debates and refutations, those residing there not only failed to show respect to this lord, they wouldn't even stand up when he came to teach. Due to the later people's hostile attitude toward the earlier ones, a slow-spreading epidemic occurred. When they persisted in their negative intentions toward one who was completely pure, he gave dharma teachings in sequence. Due to this lord's great compassion and power, not even the slightest illness affected any of the teachers or students. When the inner circle members were asked about undefined terms, bringing them before the later ones did not result in any harshness.

In particular, when he taught the common dharma at Lojang Pel Yema, a great shower of flowers fell like rain from the sky, causing their hatred, attachment, and wrong views to disperse like clouds, making them feel as if they had not [properly] listened to the dharma before. At Chakö Shong, he arranged extensive offerings before the self-arisen Eleven-Faced [Avalokiteśvara] and made aspirational prayers, which also resulted in a great shower of flowers. When he made torma offerings and entreaties before the Red Spear-wielding Vaiśravaṇa, a red arrow-banner fell into this lord's lap. The attendant said, "This is a very auspicious sign. There are accounts of similar occurrences with Buston Khaché in the past," and they were filled with wonder. These showers of flowers were similar to when the Blessed One taught the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras and the gods showered mandārava and great mandārava flowers and so forth. Similarly, when the lords of wisdom like Sakya Paṇḍita and the master scholar Yagdrong and others spread the feast of the holy dharma in the northern regions, great showers of flowers also fell. Just as the gods make offerings, what need to mention humans? This was a sign shown deliberately to all. Therefore, what need to mention receiving the nectar of dharma from this holy one? Whether seeing his form, hearing his speech, entering the door of his teachings and following his guidance by studying and contemplating any of his treatises, or even merely having faith in his doctrine and making offerings to the holders of his teachings - all these are supreme fortune. Therefore, each of you should rejoice in your connection to him.

He was then invited by the great Dharma King Tsangchen Dondrub Dorje, a powerful upholder of the doctrine, to Zhiga Samdrubtse, the great administrative seat of the four districts' glorious activities. There he received many profound and extensive teachings such as the long-life empowerment and Mahākāla instructions, and was regarded as supreme among all the lamas.

Then in spring of the Dragon year, he was invited by the Bodongpas to Jagö Shong where he established one dharma session. Miraculous signs appeared just as before. In the summer of that year, he was invited to Dzadong Tsang by the Dharma King Rigden Jangpa Dagchen Namkha Dorje and his sons. He established two dharma sessions and extensively turned the wheel of the Tripiṭaka teachings. He also gave various tantric teachings including the extremely simple guidance on the Five Deities of Yamāntaka and the two systems of Cakrasaṃvara - Luipa and Drilbupa. A shower of flowers fell, about the size of the area of Norden Khyonkar, causing everyone to marvel and speak of it incessantly with wonder.

At that time, he also prophesied to Chöje Murabjampa about a monastery, pointing to where Thubten Yangchen monastery now stands, saying "In the future, there will be extensive recitations of Māmakī there." This account came directly from my own holy guru, the lord of wisdom Ngawang Chökyi Dragpa.

Immediately after handing over his seat in the Horse year and arriving at Thubten, he was invited by Khenpo Namkha Palkyong of Chum Dechen and went there with about a hundred monks who were eager for the sacred speech teachings.

From then on, he gave abundant precious sacred speech teachings along with supplementary instructions and many other empowerments and liberating instructions. Having established all beings there, with Khenchen at their head, in complete satisfaction and unwavering faith, he departed for Thubten. Then in the seventh month of that year, invited by Namkha Dorje and his sons, he went to Jadong Tsang. When he had previously gone to Ongtsang, this lord and a select group of teachers and students went to offer butter lamps at Musu. There was a very powerful statue of four-armed Mahākāla there. When some monks engaged in inappropriate behavior, the principal deity among the eight-faced transcendent and worldly protectors there, the raven-faced one, displayed extremely wrathful aspects. This lord performed the special instruction of mixing heart-essence according to the unique oral instructions, after which there were no wrathful aspects at all and they followed exactly as instructed. At that time, there were about seven hundred and fifty monks, and over three hundred studying the Prajñāpāramitā texts. The study and teaching of both sūtra and tantra increased greatly. At the end of that year, invited by the Bodongpas, he established one dharma session at Ngönmo Dzong. In the first month of the Sheep year, he went to Thropur where he made extensive butter lamp offerings and performed dharma teachings and aspirational prayers as if in competition. At that time, the monastic assembly numbered about eight hundred scattered members.

After being invited by the northern ruler, he went to Ongtsang where he performed innumerable virtuous activities benefiting both the doctrine and sentient beings.

Then when this lord reached his fifty-ninth year, in the Female Fire Sheep year, when inauspicious signs appeared indicating obstacles to his life, he performed practices to avert them. In a dream, a woman who seemed to be his mother said that Tārā had emerged and the life obstacles would be averted.

However, when he remained uncertain about this, his own composition "The Ocean of Siddhis: A Praise to Tārā" spontaneously resounded in space with a thundering sound. Still not feeling complete certainty, one day he had a direct vision of Noble Lady Tārā in the center, with Lord Precious Dragpa Gyaltsen on the right and Nyanpul Chungwa Tsugtor Gyal on the left. Noble Lady said, "Since I will remove this current obstacle, keep your heart at ease."

Furthermore, this holy one maintained the life-force of the tradition of Victorious Kunga Zangpo and the tradition of Guhyasamāja according to Jñānapāda's system. All the haughty gods and spirits offered their life essence and followed his commands. When Lord Vajradhara was about to pass away, in a dream he took up an image of Lord Dragpa that was before him, which transformed into an extremely beautiful form of Mañjuśrī-vajra.

Then he dreamed that one of the little toes of his feet was missing. [He was told] that this change was not unfavorable, and it was prophesied that in the future, someone who would uphold his tradition would establish the tradition of Mañjuśrī-vajra. This lord was that very person. When this lord was told how the Great Bodhisattva had directly beheld the Great Sakya Master and received the Mañjuśrī-vajra empowerment from him, he requested that empowerment be given to him. [The response was]: "Now is an appropriate time for the empowerment. Complete it with this. " He was given the extremely beautiful and blessed Mañjuśrī-vajra statue that was the sacred support of Zangskar Lotsāwa's practice, and thus the auspicious connection was established. When he was close to receiving the complete Mañjuśrī-vajra empowerment, he later received the Mañjuśrī-vajra empowerment from the holy Gyaltsab. Having composed texts and established ritual practices and offerings, these have now spread in all directions. Furthermore, when he taught the Vajrakīla teachings of Yagphug Sangye Palwa, Khyenrab Wangchug Dragpa Zangpo and others, although King Yutreng, Bara Nagpo, and the three Tsatsa-mo created many obstacles, they offered their life essence to this lord and provided only favorable conditions. It was universally agreed that this lord was more powerful than the previous two. When he arrived at Chum Dechen and stayed for a few days at the Tanag Lu hot springs, that night he dreamed of meeting the five Ajang brothers. They offered him a white cloth missing two tassels, prostrated, and said "We will not create obstacles and will take care of you. " This came to pass exactly as dreamed.

On one occasion, he said in the teaching courtyard: "Now that I am getting old and weary, I must be reborn as a divine youth in a lotus womb in Sukhāvatī." Once, when many teachers and students were traveling toward Bodong, a great dust storm severely affected his body while riding. When they arrived at a guest house and were having lunch, he said, "Today's occurrence was due to the impurities of the vessel. Now, by taking rebirth in a lotus womb in Sukhāvatī, such faults will not occur."

To fulfill the enlightened intention of Vajradhara father and son, he newly commissioned thirteen life-sized scroll paintings of the Guhyasamāja lineage, thangkas of Maitreyanātha, paintings of the Eighty-four Mahāsiddhas, the Sakya Kabum, the collected works of Vajradhara, and the collected works of the Great Bodhisattva.

He newly established offerings and arrangements for twenty-five golden statues of the Guhyasamāja lineage with Mahākāla, which were offered by the patron of the doctrine Aseng Dorje Tenpa, along with robes and seats. When establishing new commitments and arrangements for the complete Vajrāvali maṇḍala thangka and three auspicious maṇḍala thangkas offered by Dharma King Dondrub Dorje, he beheld the pure realm of Sukhāvatī. At that time, he also made aspirational prayers for Sukhāvatī.

In the Horse year, Master Sonam Gyaltsen ascended to the Sakya throne. As Lord Yongdzin took the seat of E-waṃ and Lord Sang Rinpa took the seat of Lingde, he was very pleased. The students also did not disappoint their great hopes.

Having not disappointed their great hopes, the students fulfilled the enlightened intention of the master and his spiritual sons in a proper and complete way. He then said that it was now time to make the connection through pure aspirational prayers and prepare to go to Sukhāvatī. He established group aspirational prayers for Sukhāvatī and commissioned paintings of the pure realm exactly as he had beheld it.

He went to teach at E-waṃ. He gave extensive teachings combining the root and explanatory tantras known as "The Teaching of Placing the Child in the Mother's Lap," as well as the Ocean of Ḍākinīs empowerment and others.

In his sixtieth year, the Earth Male Monkey year in the first month, he performed the wrathful Vajrakīla rituals and prayers. Afterward, having been invited by Gyakharwa, he established one teaching session at Gang Khar. Then, being invited to the farewell ceremony of the elderly Thromdawa, he established them in temporary and lasting benefits. During summer when teaching the Path and Result at Thubten, the assembly hall could not contain all the gatherers and stone seats had to be arranged.

Since he had the intention to depart to another realm, he completed the respective remaining teachings for each of his disciples. He also gave the path of the three higher empowerments of the Sacred Word, and other partial teachings that were not previously given publicly, such as the textual explanation of Sadputra and others. Going to Gyakhar, he completed the remaining teachings for Muchen Sangye Rinchen. He went to E-waṃ. When completing the remaining teachings for the holy Yongdzin, particularly when giving the profound and special authorization of Mahākāla and giving instructions, his speech showed slight signs of trembling.

When he accomplished this, there were two deities who were fearful of each other. When this was accomplished, he said "Now my mind is at ease. Please deliver this to Chöje Sangye Rinchen," and returned to Thubten.

He gave special teachings as if having completed all activities for the benefit of the doctrine and beings to: 
1. Dharma King Dondrub Dorje
2. The great northern lord Namkha Dorje
3. The Dharma King of Lowo, Tashi Gön
4. The great scholar of Minyag, Dragpa Dorje, who was both a direct disciple and equal in faith and devotion
5. The great abbot of Lowo, Sonam Lhundrup

During some occasions of practice, he received one Vajra instruction lineage empowerment every few years:
1. At age 13 from Wapa Chöje
2. At age 25 from Vajradhara
3. At age 37 from the Great Bodhisattva
4. At age 49, after going to establish himself at E-waṃ, from the holy Gyaltsab

He said, "Now there is no place to receive empowerments except for spending some time at Tenzin Phug." Once when asked about what would happen in his sixty-first year, and on another occasion, his final words indicated he would depart to another realm, saying things like "I think I will follow the venerable Sakyapa father and son."

At that time, he had intended to establish teachings at Sakya, but Kongton Chenpo suggested: "The suitable disciples are right here, and since your body is somewhat weak, it would be better not to establish teachings." Therefore, he made an offering of butter lamps to Mañjuśrī that year.

When going to make torma offerings to the Dharma protectors, afterward when conditions were suitable, since they were constructing a silver reliquary stupa for the precious master at Densa, [he suggested] making whatever gold and silver contributions possible and preparing tea offerings. Then he said he would not go anywhere.

In the tenth month of that year, he went to perform wrathful Vajrakīla practices, received monthly provisions, and established a fifteen-day teaching session. During this time, he gave teachings and led prayers.

Although he had planned to go to the great monastic seat, due to the influence of one or two who had attained power through the blessings of the Lord of Māra who was labeled as a spiritual friend, when they went to Sakya to perform torma offerings and send messages to the Rinpungpa, they advised it would be better to prevent problems that would arise in the east and west towers. When officials with sealed orders came from both Sengge Tse and Drakrinchen Tse to prevent the teachings, along with Lord Donphagpa, this lord said: "My going to Sakya is not merely for the Rinpungpa's torma offerings. Since these are very troubled times, I am going for the sake of making aspirational prayers for great benefit and happiness to arise in the world after the conflicts subside."

He told some monks that if they did not reach Sakya this time, they would not reach Sakya in this lifetime. When he made prayers through praise to Sakya Paṇḍita's "King of Dharma," one day a great gathering demon created obstacles.

When it was said that now there would be a chance to go to the pleasant place [Dewa chog], "You all should also prepare to go," as prophesied, permission to depart was granted. On the eighth day of the eleventh month, they set out. On the tenth, they arrived at the great monastic seat. On the fourteenth, during the festival day of Sakya Paṇḍita, they offered a feast to more than two thousand visiting monks. There were extensive offerings and exchanges with Dagchen Sönam Gyaltsen. Along with establishing distributions of one zho of gold each to every group of twelve monks, they offered five hundred khal of butter for lamps. For two months, they continuously offered twenty butter lamps day and night before the Mañjuśrī Zi'öd Barwa. They also made appropriate offerings to other temples and made vast aspirational prayers for: the general flourishing of the doctrine; the good health and increased enlightened activities of the doctrine holders; the purity of monastic discipline and increase of Dharma practice among the monastic communities; the pacification of conflicts and spread of happiness and abundance like clouds of the Golden Age; the fulfillment of wishes of patrons devoted to the lord himself, such as Rinpung Norbu Zangpo; the peaceful expansion and military might of the governance of Dharma King Döndrub Dorje and others; and particularly for the absence of obstacles and gathering of favorable conditions for constructing a golden statue of the Buddha, and for teachings and studies to continue for a long time. Two teaching sessions were established. The first session's provisions were offered by those of the Great Temple, and the latter session's provisions were offered by those of Lhasa Dzong. The resident monks' services and the sequence of teachings were mostly similar to the previous teaching period.

In particular, to many great lamas and dignitaries including the Lord Precious Sönam Gyaltsen, he bestowed the authorization of Iron-Sword Hayagrīva. He gave transmissions of Hevajra-tantra, Sampuṭa-tantra, and Ocean of Great Bliss Empowerment, as well as empowerments for Kṛṣṇa-vajra Commentary System, Guhyasamāja, Mañjuśrī-vajra, Cakrasaṃvara Ocean of Ḍākinīs, and others. At that time, those close to him heard him say that the minor teachings given then were not post-empowerment teachings. During his stay there, he made eleven torma offerings daily at the shrine of Bse mgon, and three offerings each without fail at other protector chapels. At that time, these protector deities seemed to prefer elaborate activities like chanting and feast offerings rather than just mantra recitation and torma offerings. Therefore, when he said to arrange feast offerings, some teachers and students occasionally performed extensive torma ritual practices with feast offerings at the shrine of Bse mgon. They also requested to install a permanent torma for daily practice at Bse mgon's shrine. They newly established an Avalokiteśvara statue above the entrance gate. They made extensive entreaties for: protecting the doctrine and its holders, the long continuation of teaching and study, the absence of obstacles for constructing the Buddha's golden statue, and other purposes. At that time, it is said that he had a vision of the great Sakya master in a dream and received instructions from him. Thus, without a doubt, this holy one took rebirth for the sake of helpless beings in this age of strife, as he never wavered for even a moment from activities of body, speech, and mind that were solely for the benefit of the doctrine and beings.

Having mastery over ocean-like qualities such as clairvoyance and others, all that was prophesied came to pass exactly. For example, when he gave the authorization of the Great Compassionate One in the Kyergang tradition to Döring Künpang Chenpo, he said, "This is an unbroken lineage of direct vision up to the great Bodhisattva. We haven't had time to practice it due to our teaching schedule. Since this Dharma Lord is different from others and has received it through direct vision, you should practice it." Accordingly, when practiced in Tsamorong, he had a direct vision. Knowing that Khedrup Lodrö Rabyang and Je Lhachok Senge and others would benefit the teachings, he paid great attention to them from their youth, and later it turned out exactly so. When some monks at Kyedtsal encountered obstacles, he taught them obstacle-removing instructions, and by practicing these, many were freed from obstacles. On such occasions, he said, "If you think about cases like these, you will understand, but since there are those with eyes who see and ears who hear, do not speak of this to others." When Ralnga Nyerchen Ralö Dorje asked for predictions about longevity and other matters, he said, "Worldly activities are meaningless. Make offerings to this manager, serve the doctrine and sangha as much as possible, and increase virtuous practice as much as you can. You will have a long life." This came to pass exactly as stated, and later his fame spread in all directions. When Rinpungpa brought troops against Gyaltse, he said to everyone who came before him, "This year, will Gyaltse be captured or not?"

Having asked everyone to go together, when they said it was impossible, he smiled broadly and said, "We cannot go. This is what happens when merit is exhausted due to wrong conduct. " But he said that the people of Gyaltse had not conducted themselves wrongly. At that time, when Pön Yungpa had to be imprisoned and was asked for predictions about whether he would be released or not, he definitively said he would not be released, which came to pass exactly as stated. Also, when at Dzadong, he said to Chöje Mü Rabjampa, pointing to the monastery of Thubten Yangchen that exists there now, "You, Chakshänpa, will have great enlightened activity up there. " On another occasion, he said, "You will encounter a great obstacle in a northern region. At that time, remember me. " Later, when he went to Mangkhar and arrived at Mangkhar Valley, his horse stumbled and he nearly fell from horseback. Remembering the previous prophecy, he made prayers and did not fall, as the Lord Lama said. Regarding other prophecies he made to Pön Drung Yungba and Je Yongdzin and others, there are countless examples, but fearing [the text would be] too long, I have not written them down. At that time, when Dagchen Lodrö Gyaltsen came to meet him, he said, "These days you are very precious to the Sakya doctrine, and since there may be obstacles to your life, it would be good if you did some practice here. " Although such advice was given, knowing that there would be greater benefit to beings in another realm and knowing the length of his life-force, he did not stay.

From Sangye, countless offerings were received, which he allocated to the restoration fund for the outer and inner supports of the old central temple. He said, "Now that all wishes are fulfilled, we must quickly reach Thubten." In his sixty-first year, on the eighth day of the first Hor month of the Female Earth Bird year, he departed from the great monastic seat. That night, he stayed at a monastery in Rasa. The next day, he made butter lamp offerings at Naza Drakphuk and made extensive aspirational prayers. At that time in a dream, he saw himself sitting atop what appeared to be the upper assembly hall, while below, another chant leader was disrupting the sequence of religious practices of our own assembly. When he made a great effort, it appeared that he was able to set things right. He said, "After our passing, it seems there will be some small service to the doctrine. Afterward, it seems something joyful will come." This appears to refer to how the Great Omniscient One would come to restore the doctrine at this religious center when it was nearly extinct, as prophesied, and how Ling Tö Densa-pa Chenpo Lodrö Jungnä, widely recognized as the incarnation of the Great Omniscient One himself, would raise up the doctrine from its decline. At that time, he also said, "Horse, may you grant much happiness. I will care for you in the future." Then, after making aspirational prayers at Trophu, he proceeded to Thubten. Although his intention was to depart for another realm, since the Bodongpas strongly invited him and some monks also requested that it would be good if he came, he first went to Mordzong. At that time, the Lord said,

Through arriving at Thubten, there would be fewer distractions and it would be joyful everywhere, but some created obstacles. However, he said he felt at ease since it was close to the great monastic seat. Then, he established a fifteen-day teaching session where he gave detailed and extensive explanations on many treatises including Pramāṇa, with many points of analysis and refutation, which brought joy to everyone's minds. These days, rainbow clouds appeared daily, covering the sky with various unprecedented patterns never seen before, and flowers rained down. The sun was brighter than before, and its heat melted all the ice in the central area. Particularly on the eighteenth day, these signs increased even more than before, and he himself paused his teaching to relate many historical accounts. Then, based on the context of how the doctrine had previously waxed and waned, he spoke of how three people would discuss at Thubten, and of these three who were said to go to the monastic seat, they would go their separate ways - one would follow later, and two might eventually go together as one. He gave many such coded messages. In connection with discussing how the Sakya hierarchs and other lamas had passed away, he said he would definitely pass away on the twenty-first for the sake of making it easy to observe memorial services and such. Then saying "Now the talk will come quickly," he looked into space and said, "This appears to be a death omen for a Sakyapa doctrine holder who is a Ngorpa. I am just joking. For others, it would indeed be a death omen."

At noon he looked toward the middle distance and asked, "Do you monks see it? There are many spectacles like horses coming to welcome. " This caused uncertainty among all those in the teaching hall. On the morning of the nineteenth, he showed slight signs of illness as if affected by a shadow, though there was no apparent pain besides being somewhat thirsty. During the teachings, at the point of explaining "all compounded phenomena are impermanent" from the Samuccaya, he paused. He concluded his teaching at the passages concerning "the nature without cessation" from Prajñāpāramitā, the section on the path of seeing in the Gtan la dbab pa bsdu ba commentary, and the passage "therefore the blind do not see" from Pramāṇavārttika - these were signs that he would not remain in this realm. That day, he also performed rituals including complete offerings of robes and distributing tea to the assembly. On the twentieth day, when Gazi Kunga Yeshe checked his pulse and reported there would be no jaundice, he said, "There will be no recovery from this illness. The Guru father and sons are also residing in Sukhāvatī. I think I will be reborn there. " When asked if the steward could come to Thubten with provisions for health improvement, he smiled and said, "It seems someone needs to go to the great monastic seat," and told some attendants present, "Though you all will stay here, I will go to Sukhāvatī to be with the Guru father and sons. " That day he also displayed three bodily manifestations: one remained at Ngönmo Dzong, while two went to Sakya.

A six-year-old daughter of the Lhakhang Chenmo family actually saw him riding on a remarkably wondrous mount, arriving at the two-storied residence of Thegchen Chökyi Gyalpo. Simultaneously, a young monk who was the nephew of the caretaker of Utse Nyingma actually saw him going before Mañjuśrī radiating blazing light, appearing exactly as when he had previously met him in person. At dawn on the twentieth, he performed his spiritual practices such as the extensive path ritual with great enthusiasm. He asked Gegen Sherab Gyaltsen, who was present before him, "What date is it today?" When told it was the twenty-first, he said, "I am similar to Chöje Kunga Wangchuk. " Then he slept briefly, and upon waking said, "Some amazing dreams occurred. " When asked what kind of dreams, he said, "There was a saddled horse. There were three horsemen:

1. The greater protector who came from Sakya
2. The lesser protector who came from Khau
3. Vaiśravaṇa with the red lineage who came from Jagö Shong

Three people who came from Tsedong were in their retinue, guarding the one with the saddle. They had some secret discussions. "

After sunrise, he performed a long meditation on Khecāri, and through the profound approach of Khecāri's death instructions, he departed for Sukhāvatī. Thereafter, his physical remains appeared very youthful, with a complexion that was white with a reddish glow and emanating various light rays. His eyes were half black and white, appearing extremely beautiful.

When those present before him looked, his face appeared with a slight smile. On the morning of the twenty-second, as a sign of the dissolution of his meditative absorption, white bodhicitta flowed abundantly from both nostrils. Then the precious remains were secretly transported to Thubten. At dawn on the twenty-fourth, they arrived at Thubten. When Chöje Nyentshabpa Tsultrim Zangpo immediately began to perform the cremation offering, terrifying manifestations of the Dharma protectors' displeasure occurred, making cremation impossible, so they arranged it in the form of a stūpa and placed it amidst swirling clouds of offerings. Immediately, in the completely clear sky without any haze, new patterns of rainbows spread across, and a gentle rain of flowers fell. From time to time, various melodious divine music captivated the mind, and unprecedented sweet fragrances pervaded all directions. These phenomena continued from then until the cremation of the precious remains. From the next day, the main prayer sessions were established. Furthermore, starting with the main labrang and supported by both major and minor patrons and monks, for the first month, there were two tea offerings daily and two morning meals with ceremonial seating without interruption. In the assembly, they performed extensive Medicine Buddha rituals in the morning and Guru Pūjā with aspiration prayers in the afternoon. From the day the remains arrived until the cremation, four Tantra holders, led by the reincarnation of Paṇḍita Zhönnu Gyalchok, continuously performed the Hevajra sādhana and offering ritual before the remains.

Then for one month, there were daily tea offerings and formal seating arrangements without interruption. Just as before with the religious ceremonies, with great effort they carried out tasks such as collecting stones for and laying the foundation of the sacred chamber where the inner relics would reside, and the upper floor where the Lamdré lineage holders would stay was completed without obstacles. Additionally, they accomplished inconceivable acts of generosity to crowds of people, tea offerings to various monasteries in different directions, and distributions of offerings. Then at the beginning of the eighth lunar month, the supreme spiritual guide Chöje Könchok Pel was invited and stayed at the labrang. Soon after, five Nepalese artists also arrived. Söldön Gendün Zangpo took responsibility for all internal matters including serving Chöje Ngorpa and hosting the Nepalese. Chöje Ngorpa designed the supports, prepared the dharanis for installation, and gave some tantric teachings to those interested in secret teachings. On the twenty-first of that month at dawn, when Chöje Ngorpa performed the melting offering to the precious remains, there appeared white-colored flames, beautiful shapes like conch shells and vases, pleasant sounds, networks of light filling the sky, and a rain of flowers that refreshed everyone's minds. On the full moon day when they opened the skull chamber, on both sides of the brahmarandhra where the complete skull had emerged, clear forms of Yamāntaka and Khecārī appeared. Furthermore, inconceivable relics from the cremation appeared in the forms of spherical relics and syllables.

After this, they mixed most of the bone relics with clay from sacred sites to create multiple relic objects displaying the colors of the Five Buddha Families, each containing the essence mantras of any of the four great dhāraṇīs, and installed these as inner supports with their dhāraṇīs. They created one level of tsha tshar containing mantra essences and later installed these inside the stūpa. For the remaining bone relics, they created images of Mañjuśrī from sacred clay, consecrated them with gold, and distributed them to faithful ones in various directions. Then the craftsmen completed the creation of the supports with great accomplishment. On the waxing phase of the ninth lunar month, following Chöje Ngorpa's own practice tradition, they properly installed the inner supports and dhāraṇīs in the correct order. On the ninth day of that month in the afternoon, Chöje Ngorpa, along with his attendant the great master Kongtön Wangchuk Drubpa and Chöje Chentsabpa and others, performed the sādhana offering ceremony based on the Hevajra thangka painting and conducted the purification consecration ceremony. On the tenth day, they performed the main ceremony, and when they scattered flowers for the long-life prayers, the sun rose directly onto the heart of the support through the eastern window of the sanctum, creating a most excellent auspicious connection. That morning, the labrang hosted a celebratory tea ceremony with distributions, made extensive offerings to gatherings of people, and at lunch, Nangpa Rinchen Tsepa offered an excellent formal tea ceremony. All the teachers and disciples harmoniously intoned garlands of auspicious verses, making it an occasion of great virtue and splendor.

The artisans were filled with joy and satisfaction when they completed their work with support and provisions.

In this way, regarding all the arrangements from the installation of the inner supports—including the thirteen-cubit-tall golden Buddha statue, the bedroom statue, and the festival thangkas—until their excellent completion, since Chöje Ngorpa supervised everything, his kindness to the doctrine was great indeed. Then, in accordance with the earth offering, Chöje Ngorpa departed for E-waṃ. Then, in the common era, on the tenth day of the waxing phase of the sixth month of the Iron Male Dog year according to the Mongolian system, the great scholar of the five fields of knowledge, Wangchuk Drubpa Gyaltsen Pazangpo, was enthroned as regent, and the flourishing of the doctrine became like a summer ocean, evident to all.

Regarding the manner in which the five kinds of enlightened activities continuously manifested without interruption: From the age of thirty-two until sixty-one, through great diligence, he maintained an uninterrupted stream of explanation and study of sūtra and tantra. As a result, he produced three incomparable great beings capable of benefiting the doctrine, five crown ornaments of the great assembly, five great pillars supporting the doctrine from the early group of disciples, twelve ornaments beautifying the Land of Snows from the middle group, six illuminators of the doctrine from the later group, two learned reincarnates like the sun and moon, seven lords of accomplishment, and thirty-three scholars who properly maintained the tradition of dharma discourse, among others.

1. Among the three incomparable great beings, the first was the pure Khön lineage holder of Sakya, the Lord of Power Dagchen Sönam Gyaltsen Palzangpo. After completing his studies of both sūtra and tantra under this master, he later became the throne holder of Zhithok. His younger brother Dagchen Döndrub Gyaltsen Palzangpo and the eastern lineage holder of Great Mañjuśrī, Dagchen Kunga Tashi Gyaltsen Palzangpo were the three.

2. The five crown ornaments of the great assembly were:
2.1 Chöje Gyalwa Özer, the throne holder of Upper Neu monastery, the Vajrāsana of Tibet
2.2 The great scholar Takpuk Kunga Paljor, throne holder of Lower Neu, who established a new tradition of excellent exposition at the lower courtyard of Sangphu
2.3 The lord of scholars, Pandita Könchok Tsultrim, abbot of Pal Khordechen, who also served as abbot of Zhalu
2.4 The great Zhalu translator Chökyong Zangpo, abbot of Zhalu, who also served as abbot of Gya Chakri and Dratang monasteries and became a great pioneer in the tradition of sciences
2.5 Jangsem Jinpa Zangpo, abbot of Gaden Jampa Ling of Ngamring. It appears he was the guru from whom the siddha Thangtong Gyalpo received the Niguma teachings.

3. The five great pillars supporting the doctrine from the early group of disciples were: First, Jamyang Chöje Kunga Chözang, who after the passing of Jamchen Rabjampa, became the throne holder of Kyetshal and composed many excellent teachings on the topics of the Tripiṭaka.

3. 1 After Jamchen Rabjampa passed away, [Jamyang Chöje Kunga Chözang] became the throne holder of Kyetshal and composed many excellent foundational teachings on topics of the Tripiṭaka. 3. 2 Norbu Phuntsok, master of the Tripiṭaka, was the third abbot of Kyetshal. 3. 3 The great scholar Lhawang Lodrö established a new monastery at Zhari Kyetshal. He was the one from whom Je Könchok Lhundrub received the Kadampa teachings. 3. 4 Bumtraksum Jampa Chödön established a new monastery at Jagö Shong. The monastery was named Nyenyö Jagö Shong. 3. 5 Panchen Zhunggyapa Ngödrub Palbar - he established the new Chökhor Lhunpo. 4. The twelve ornaments beautifying the Land of Snows from the middle group were:
4. 1 The seventh abbot of glorious E-waṃ Chöden, the sublime teacher Könchok Pel, who made both general and specific teachings flourish extensively. 4. 2 The abbot of glorious Nālanda, the great Muspa Jamyang Sangye Rinchen, who later served as abbot of E-waṃ and Ling Gawa Dechen. He taught Lamdre fifty-one times. 4. 3 His own throne holder, the great Kongtön Wangchuk Drubpa, who served as throne holder for twenty-five years and through reasoning and scriptural knowledge outshone the eloquence of many great scholars including Shakya Chokden. He was renowned as an emanation of Avalokiteśvara. 4. 4 Narthangpa Rigpe Wangchuk Chödrak Gyatso, who was the third abbot of Thubten. During his time, the monastic college reached its peak of development.

These mentioned are the abbots of great religious institutions and those in high positions. Apart from them, there were teachers of individual colleges and those who gathered circles of brilliant students in various regions, independently maintaining teaching and study, as well as those who taught empowerments, tantra explanations and instructions at various monasteries around the snow mountains.

Those who lived in remote mountain forests, charnel grounds, and border regions, spending equal time in life-practice and other activities, were limitless. In brief, except for a few who were corrupted by demons of unfortunate karma and wrong views, or who were influenced by negative friends, there were none among the Sakya lineage holders of that time who were not either direct disciples, heart disciples, or grand-disciples of this lord. They all created fortunate circumstances in this land of snows.

Here is what was said:
Having thus composed this biography of the omniscient guru, lord of dharma Sönam Senge, may all negative karma and obscurations of myself and disciples be completely purified. Through the virtue of composing this, may we, teachers and students, have long life, good health, and all wishes fulfilled in this time. Like the omniscient guru, may we become ornaments of all Sakya doctrine holders.

Furthermore, may these amazing continuous teachings of the supreme illuminators of the degenerate age - the Vajra-holder, dharma king and his spiritual sons - flourish again as before at glorious Sakya. May my lineage continuously protect and increasingly develop these traditions through generations, and may all activities exactly like those of the glorious Phagpa manifest perpetually, both temporarily and ultimately. In the future, may we teachers and students be born together inseparably in Sukhāvatī, and again through countless emanations suited to each being's needs, may all be established on the path to complete liberation.

This biography called "The Sun Illuminating the Amazing Life of the Omniscient Dharma King Sönam Senge that Increases Merit"

Having thus composed [this text], the Śākya upāsaka, Paṇḍita and Vajra-holder Ngawang Kunga Sönam Dragpa Gyaltsen Palzang, who takes upon his crown the dust from the feet of many proper dharma-practicing teachers - primarily mentioning the noble dharma king brothers known as Jamyang Wangpo and the victorious great Mupa Sangye Gyaltsen - having repeatedly made the teachings of the omniscient dharma king the object of study and contemplation, seeing that he upheld all the intentions of the previous Sakya masters purely like the Buddha's words without mixing, and that he was unrivaled among other doctrine holders, was moved by great unwavering faith.

Having largely followed the text arranged by the great scholar Chönam Gyal of Densa monastery, which compiled the excellent biographical accounts written by various direct disciples of the Omniscient One himself, this was composed in the Female Fire Ox year, during the third auspicious day of the first month, on the day of making offerings commemorating when the previous precious master Palden Tsemo departed to the great pure paradise without abandoning his body.

The scribe who composed this at the auspicious Langtang building at glorious Sakya was Tashi Döndrup of Shabtö, who possessed clear analytical intelligence and was skilled in composition. May this bring benefit in both the short and long term.

By the merit of composing this, may I too become one who benefits the Sakya teachings both temporarily and ultimately, just like the Omniscient Dharma Lord and the Mantra-holding Guru Kunga Rinchen. May it be virtuous! Sarva Maṅgalam!

[Title] The Biography of the Omniscient Sönam Senge

[Title] The Wonderful Garland of Precious Biography of the Lord Guru

Namas Guru Pādāya

I bow at the feet of the Guru who, though heavy with the burden of perfect qualities, remains above all;
Who, though attaining the supreme high state, pervades the three realms;
Who, though equally loving toward all beings, guides those of fortunate karma;
Who teaches a single meaning through many skillful methods. The sole cause of all pure merit,
In the pure doctrine of Śākya Siṃha,
The one who explains all sūtras and tantras in various ways -
Though none can properly express the deeds of that Omniscient Guru,
At the repeated request of faithful disciples,
I joyfully compose this brief respectful account
Just as it appears to the minds of ordinary disciples. Our supreme guide, the universally renowned Omniscient Gobo Rabjampa Sönam Senge, in ultimate truth is inseparably one with the great Vajradhara, as established through scripture, reasoning and oral instructions. Though no one can describe his biography exactly as it was, nevertheless, following the meaning of "Just as the sun of the Buddha descends upon the mountains of disciples according to their capacity," I shall describe just a portion of how he displayed virtuous deeds in this snowy land during the degenerate age, for the sake of us disciples of lesser intellect, while maintaining the appearance of an ordinary spiritual friend. Here is the outline:.

Born into a noble family and entering the teachings,
Traveling to Central and Tsang to seek the holy Dharma,
Establishing teaching centers to spread the doctrine,
And performing unceasing enlightened activities - these are the five. 1. Regarding the first, the biography of his birth into a noble family:
When holy beings take birth in any place, they do so having previously considered where they can benefit many beings - this is the nature of things. As stated in the Uttaratantra:
"Though beyond birth and such,
Being of compassionate nature
They display birth, death, sickness and aging
For the sake of seeing reality exactly as it is. "

It is said thus: This venerable holy master was born in the region of Domlung Valley in Domla, Dokham, as the son of father Rutsha Zhangkyab and mother Gyalwa Men, in the female Earth-Bird year. His faculties were clear and appealing, and he was completely beyond ordinary childish behavior. It is said that when he reached seven years of age, he learned reading and understood merely by being shown the letters. This master had one elder brother from the same mother named Geshé Yeshé Gyaltsen. Among the five siblings sharing the same father and mother, he was second youngest. The two eldest, Lhazö and the younger Lekpa Gyaltsen, became monks. Lekpa Gyaltsen went to Central Tibet and Tsang, met this master, and became enriched with profound and extensive teachings including empowerments, transmissions and oral instructions. He then returned to Dokham where he extensively benefited the doctrine and beings.

2. Regarding his biography of entering the teachings: When this master reached ten years of age, seeing all of saṃsāra as being of the nature of suffering, a powerful renunciation arose in him. Having requested ordination from his parents and receiving their permission, he requested ordination from the holy upholder of discipline, the bodhisattva called Kunga Bum. His ordination name was given as Sönam Senge, as he became one who possessed the individual liberation that is the root of the doctrine.

Then, beginning his studies under that master, in all subjects such as studying the Collected Topics and holding the scriptures, his supreme intelligence was so vast that it was beyond others' comprehension, amazing everyone. All proclaimed that "This young monk will definitely become a Rabjampa scholar," and thus the title "Rabjam" naturally stuck to him from that time.

His diligence was also superior to others. Being the youngest among a group of student monks studying under that master, when he would recite his memorization from early dawn, the elder students would say "Your excessive diligence disturbs our sleep" and "The master has also criticized this." They would frequently beat him up. Later, the master instructed him to complete his memorization of just one chapter of Madhyamakāvatāra silently before the morning call, and after the call to recite together with the others.

From the great scholar Gobo Rabjampa Sherab Palwa and from Kachu Jinzang, he received many profound and vast teachings. It is said that from Lama Wapa Gyaltsen Özer, who came from the region of Nyagre, he also properly received the empowerment of the oral instructions of Hevajra tradition. In brief, during his first journey to Central Tibet and Tsang when he was nineteen years old, he had thoroughly mastered the thirteen major texts including Pramāṇa, up through the three kinds of knowledge from the Prajñāpāramitā Rong commentary, and the stages of synthesis composed by Chöje Gegyalwa including the Sun Mandala and the Wheel of Contradictions. It is said that even his general knowledge of the scriptural language was equal to what a happy Geshé of today might possess. 2. Regarding his biography of traveling to Central Tibet and Tsang to seek the holy Dharma, there are two parts:

2. 1. First, regarding his biography of traveling to Central Tibet to seek the holy Dharma:
In that very year when he was nineteen, in the Hare year, a strong wish arose to go study in Central Tibet and Tsang. As he prepared provisions and travel companions, he thought: "Having abandoned this ocean of poison of afflictions in my homeland, may I swiftly journey to the wonderful hundred-petaled lotus garden of the dharma centers of Central Tibet, the abode where flocks of learned and disciplined ones play!"

Then, at the New Year of the Dragon year, he set out from his homeland together with many spiritual friends. Among that group of travelers, it appears the youngest was Lama Wangchuk Gyaltsen of Khamsar Teng. Then they arrived at Rador, where for several days he received teachings on Prajñāpāramitā texts from Chöje Rinlo.

He also received the authorization of Orange Mañjuśrī. Then, traveling via the Kong route, he gradually went to Samyé, Sangphu, and Lhasa, where he extensively performed the Seven-Branch Prayer and aspirations. Then, arriving safely at Nālendra during the summer without obstacles, he came before Rongton Thams cad mkhyen pa, and for a time his aspirations were fulfilled. At that time, when Gobo Rabjampa Sherab Palwa was making his hundred offerings before Rongton Thams cad mkhyen pa, in the list of "one hundred and one students including Rabjampa," that Rabjampa referred to this master himself. At that time, seeing and hearing Chöje Rongton turning the wheel of Dharma while sitting resplendently amidst an ocean-like assembly, his joy and faith greatly increased, and thinking "all those gathered here are exclusively learned in scripture and reasoning," he felt both devotion and humility. When he first went to the center of the basic logic classes, after a few days he assessed their level of understanding. Then he joined the minor scripture classes and assessed their level as before. Then he entered the intermediate scripture classes, and as there were many engaging discussions from the perspective of comparing with those who followed the system of the more challenging intermediate texts, he spent that summer studying intermediate scriptures. Before Chöje Rongton, he received all the teachings that were given from the Dharma throne during that summer session, and he also received the authorization of White Wrath [Tumpo Karpo] that was transmitted from the great abbot.

Since Rongton Chöje was nearing the time of passing into peace, it seems there was not much opportunity to study with him for long. That autumn, following his teacher Lopön Lorin, he went towards Kyishö to teach Dharma. Meeting with Lingmé Paṇḍita Sherab Palden in Lhasa, he offered fresh tea and dry tea, and received the authorization for the Nāmasaṃgīti and the unique recitation method of Dharmapāla with its transmission. He said that since many stories were being told about the previous masters like the great abbot, it brought great joy to his mind. Then until the summer retreat of the Snake year, he taught Dharma around Tsang Chushul, which brought great inspiration to his mind. He again returned to Nālendra for the summer teachings.

2. The chapter on traveling to Tsang and seeking the Dharma has three parts:
2.1. Seeking the teachings of the Tripiṭaka
2.2. Seeking the teachings of Mantra
2.3. The meaning accomplished through these

At that time, he thought to himself: "I need to rely on a spiritual friend who is learned in the vast Tripiṭaka and complete my studies. Since Rongton Chöje is no longer present, who else would be good?" Then he heard: "In the forest grove of Drepung in Ü, the spiritual friend Sangye Pel, who expounds a hundred texts, surrounded by intelligent and diligent disciples, proclaims the sound of Dharma day and night." The moment this supreme being heard these words, his hairs stood on end with joy and faith, and like a beautiful-petaled white lotus in a lake, his determination to travel without hesitation became firm.

At the age of twenty-one, in the female Earth Snake year, he went before the lord of scholars Sangye Pel. At that time, one year had passed since the establishment of the Drepung monastic college. Seeing that it was a time when the monk population was large, conduct was pure, and teaching and study were greatly flourishing, he felt immense joy. From the very beginning, he entered into the major scriptural studies and heard all the texts being taught, including Pramāṇa, Vinaya, Abhidharma, and others. Due to his own great intellectual capacity and extensive foundation of study, combined with the teacher's expertise and the college's emphasis on explanation and study, his understanding and ability to debate on all words and meanings of the piṭakas expanded vastly like summer waters. All his teachers and fellow monks would say, "This holy being must certainly have accumulated immeasurable training in previous lives - such capability is impossible through study in this life alone, no matter how great one's intelligence." The great Jamchen Rabjampa was also very pleased.

He held the "Great-Headed Khampa" in very high regard. He spoke to the great patron who upheld the teachings with power, Drungchen Norbu Zangpo, saying: "Among my students, there is this intelligent Khampa scholar. I hope he will become a great geshé who will benefit the teachings in the future. Therefore, please support him with favorable conditions and provisions." Drungchen Norbu Zangpo agreed to this.

Having given instructions to the great householder bodhisattva Ra Nga Nyerchen Ra Long Dorje, saying "Provide continuous support with robes and necessities for Gobo Rabjampa," and while staying at Ngor, arrangements were made to receive monthly provisions for both teacher and student from Samdrub Tse. Inner Drung Rawa also accepted the instructions and provided proper service. After [Rongton] passed into peace, each year they would offer fine wool for robes, saying "This is for this year's robes. " Thus, through the power of his ever-increasing dedication to study and contemplation, he gained fearless confidence in all the piṭakas. When he reached twenty-five years of age in the female Water Bird year, thinking to perform extensive teaching rounds of many texts for the sake of serving the guru and teachings, all the scholars of Ü-Tsang gathered. Due to rules requiring construction work at the Go-khang of Sangphu, he needed to go to Sangphu. At that time, due to a serious illness related to lower spirits, he went before the lord of reasoning Gewa Gyaltsen at Dratang in the summer after completing the construction work. He received many teachings including the authorization of Iron-Sword Hayagrīva. At that time, when Chöje Gegyalwa and his students were spending the summer at a pleasant lion's den surrounded by slight hills, this master also went there as an attendant. When this master and a Dratang geshé named Chakdor Gyaltsen engaged in debate, this master generally excelled in consequential reasoning.

Through his exceptional skill in applying the four pervasions without hesitation, Lord Gegyalwa was pleased and said, "I hear you are called a Rabjampa. I thought you were just an old rustic, but you understand consequence and property-bearer well. Where did you study?" When he replied "I studied with Jamchen Rabjampa," [Gegyalwa] said "Ah, that's right! I considered him one of my disciples, so those who connect with him naturally understand consequence and property-bearer well." From then on, due to his pleasure, [Gegyalwa] would frequently give him advice. Later, when this story was recounted at Dzongkar, the Lord said, "His statement that 'he understands consequence and property-bearer' was an unprecedented observation."

2. The biography of seeking the Mantra teachings

That autumn he went to Dregung. Although he had intended to do teaching rounds as planned if his health improved, because that illness had not fully subsided, he thought "It seems this sickness won't let me go. And since one cannot know how long the lifespans of the Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo and his spiritual sons will last, I should primarily focus on receiving and practicing the profound Dharma of Vajrayāna from these masters." With this thought, he prepared to travel to the direction of Ewam Chöden. He thought to himself: "This illness is not an obstacle but an encouragement. The illness demon is not a harmful force but a spiritual friend. Moreover, it is the blessing of the Victorious Ones and their heirs to connect me with the profound path of Vajrayāna. Now I shall respectfully receive all the empowerments and paths, tantras and commentaries from the holy ones, and engage in hearing, contemplation and meditation simultaneously."

Having thought to engage in hearing, contemplation, and meditation simultaneously, he donned this great armor of superior aspiration. Then in that Bird year's winter, he went to Ewam Chöden. Just by seeing the face-maṇḍala of the holy Lord Kunga Zangpo, he developed immense, inconceivable joy and faith, as if attaining the first bhūmi. From then until the fourth lunar month of the Male Fire Mouse year, over a period of four years, he stayed in close attendance and primarily received the precious Teaching of the Word (gsung ngag rin po che) Path with Result (Lamdre) twice, the explanation of the Three Hevajra Tantras, and related empowerments and instructions on Saṃpuṭa, Vajradhātu and others. He received the Ocean of Ḍākinī Cakrasaṃvara empowerment, the guidance on the Four Stages of Black [Vajrayoginī], guidance on the Five Stages of Guhyasamāja, extensive explanation of the generation stage, the Five-Deity Yamāntaka empowerment, the instruction and reading transmission of the Ultra-Unelaborate, instruction on Freedom from the Four Attachments, the Lord's songs on Freedom from the Four Attachments, the reading transmission of its instruction manual composed by Sakya Paṇḍita and Nuppa Rigdzin Drak, and furthermore, the nine-deity Amitāyus empowerment, the permissions for the Hundred Sādhanas, Ocean [of Sādhanas] and others, lineage transmissions, reading transmissions, oral instructions and other innumerable teachings. Then in the Male Wood Dog year when he was twenty-six, when the great being Könchok Gyaltsen arrived, Lord Kunga Zangpo acted as preceptor (upādhyāya), the bodhisattva Könchok Gyaltsen as karma master, and the disciplined Sangye Pel Drup as the secret instructor.

He received complete and pure monastic ordination vows in the midst of a complete and properly supplemented Saṃgha. He dedicated himself to maintaining conscientiousness, not being tainted by even the subtlest stains of downfalls. At that time, from the great being, he received many empowerments including that of Guhyasamāja Akṣobhya and numerous transmissions including that of the Tantra Collection. From the great abbot Khachapa, he received the empowerment of the Condensed Tantric Lineages, and the permissions for Hayagrīva Chakrala, Ucchuṣma and others. From Lord Dharma Gungru Sherab Zangpo, he received many teachings on the maṇḍala measurements and the Differentiation of the Three Vows, and also a permission of the Great Red Gaṇapati. After Lord Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo passed away on the twenty-fifth day of the Vaiśākha month in the Male Fire Mouse year, Muchen Könchok Gyaltsen was appointed as regent. He stayed at Ewam Chöden during that same year and the Ox year. During the Tiger and Hare years, he traveled back and forth between Mu and Ewam Chöden.

In order to turn the wheel of Dharma appropriate for each individual, the Lord himself made unrelenting efforts, thereby obtaining inconceivably profound and vast teachings. These included:

1. On Cakrasaṃvara and Guhyāntaka:
   1.1 Explanations and transmissions of root tantras, commentarial tantras, and minor texts
   1.2 Ripening empowerments of the Three Black Compilations
   1.3 Complete instructions on generation and completion stages

2. On Guhyasamāja cycle, in addition to previous ones:

   1.2 Indian texts composed by Nāgārjuna and his spiritual sons
   1.3 Three scrolls of 'Gos
   1.4 The Great Thousand Topics by 'Gos

3. On the Path with Result (Lamdre) cycle:
   3.1 Causal empowerment
   3.2 Everything from Nairātmyā empowerment and blessing up to practice authorization, which he received from Lord Kunga Zangpo just as Dharma Lord Könchok Gyaltsen had received them, like filling a vessel
   3.3 Empowerments of the Four Transmissions of Hevajra
   3.4 Empowerment of Seventeen Tārās
   3.5 Empowerment of Yamāntaka in the Earth tradition

4. Additionally:
   4.1 The Later Eight Cycles of the Path
   4.2 The Inconceivable and the Mahāmudrā Without Letters with blessings
   4.3 Guidance on White Cakrasaṃvara
   4.4 Guidance on Chöd
   4.5 Biography of Lord Atiśa
   4.6 Commentary on Seven Points of Mind Training
   4.7 Mind Training "Peacock, Poison Destroyer"
   4.8 About forty different mind training texts compiled in one small volume including "Weapon Wheel"
   4.9 Notes on Mind Training by Drogön Palye
   4.10 Mind Training instructions composed by the great being himself
   4.11 Instructions on Prajñāpāramitā by Rongton Chöje

5. Furthermore:
   5.1 The Four Sections of Vinaya
   5.2 Vinayasūtra
   5.3 Its extensive commentary by Karmashātam
   5.4 Three Hundred Verses on Vinaya
   5.5 Prātimokṣa Sūtra and others
   5.6 The Hundred Minor Texts of Atiśa
   5.7 The famous Six Texts of Kadampa
   5.8 Complete collected works of the Five Supreme Venerable Ones
   5.9 Complete transmissions of the collected works of Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo and the great being

In addition, no one can fully enumerate the various teachings he received, such as Kamalaśīla's three stages of meditation - beginning, middle and end. All these teachings he received were not merely oral transmissions - he practiced them with detailed understanding and application, thereby accomplishing his own benefit and benefiting others when teaching. In brief, he became the master of each of these teachings.

3. Regarding the accomplishments from these [teachings]: In the Female Earth Hare year, at the request of the elder Yeshe Gyaltsen, having long served at the lotus feet of excellent spiritual guides and having obtained profound and vast teachings encompassing both sūtra and tantra, and having developed deep conviction from within, he thought "Now I should go to my homeland, meet my parents, and focus primarily on practice." Before the great being entered retreat in the Dragon year, he completed his farewell offerings. Then, at age thirty-two, in the Male Iron Dragon year, the two brothers set out on the eastern road.

As it is said:
When this supreme being set out on the path,
Like Dharmamati circling in the Noble Land,
Four kinds of joy arose in his mind:
Joy of knowing reasoning amidst great teachers,
Joy of knowing instructions amidst great meditators,
Joy of knowing tantra's meaning amidst mantra-holders,
And great joy thinking "I will meet in person
My kind parents who gave me this body."

Then he arrived at the Pleasure Grove of Dre region to meet the excellent spiritual guide Jamchen Rabjampa, thinking to rest there for a few days. At that time, during a tea gathering, the Lord said, "Today, Rabjampa Sang Lhun should defend his thesis on the Abhisamuccaya."

The Ngog Rabjampa should defend his thesis on the Differentiation of the Three Vows. When Kachupa Tensel was asked to defend his thesis on the Treasury of Valid Cognition and the Geshes of clear intellect were told to engage in consequential reasoning, that Tsethang Rabjampa Sangye Lhundrup -

There was someone there who was generally learned in all the collections of scripture and had an arrogant mind thinking "There is no one more learned than me in the Land of Snows." He said, "I will present my thesis." Opening his throat chakra of enjoyment, he gave an extensive explanation based on the absorption of cessation and mental factors, and as he was establishing various philosophical tenets at the end, when this Lord began to engage in debate with him, thinking "This person has intelligence and fame, but having not studied logic for a long time, his stammering speech will not last long," he said, "May the assembled Saṃgha please listen. Master Rabjampa has consequential arguments for me."

After four or five rounds of consequential arguments, this Lord made three equally powerful logical arguments and as he stood up extending his hand, all the teachers and students present were amazed. At first it developed into an excellent debate, and later regarding his transformation without having studied logic for about eight years, everyone unanimously declared that this excellent debate and quick speech must have come from either wisdom arising from meditation or blessing by his chosen deity.

As Tsethang Rabjampa later went to teach and study in upper regions like Kyangthur and other places, it is said that he repeatedly referred to that Ngog Rabjampa as "Tönzang" (Excellent Teacher). Then, in the Lord's mind, he thought "It would be a waste to send such a Geshe to Kham. He would be suitable for my own monastery. " So he said, "Stay here and engage in teaching and study. " He secretly sent a petition explaining the reasons why both Drungchen Norzang and the Great Being Könchok Gyaltsen needed to keep him. Although Drungchen Norzang issued a strong directive that he must stay, when an urgent request was made about needing to meet his parents and so forth, the Lord said, "Since the Great Being is the one we both consult for advice, let's request his counsel and follow whatever directive he gives. "

Then when they sent a request for counsel to the Great Being, he replied saying "Although they are now showing you great affection regarding the monastery seat and want to keep you, if it will be difficult to eventually get a monastery seat anyway, it would be better to stay in Ü-Tsang than go to Kham. " Therefore, they had to send the elder brother Yeshe Gyaltsen to Kham and stay in Drakri. At the end of that year, Tsethang Rabjampa went to teach at Kyangthur in Upper Nyang. Since Kachupa Tensel was also going to Ngor to request the Path-Result teachings from the Great Being, when he departed saying he would go request the Stages of the Path, because there were no other companions and because most monks gathered around this Lord due to his reputation for scholarship, this Lord himself acted as the assistant teacher. In the spring of the Snake year, they moved to the intermediate teachings at Chuzang Monastery in Ü.

At that time, when one or two people came requesting full ordination, the Dharma Lord asked, "Have you ever participated in the ordination ceremony at Ngor? Tomorrow we need an assistant instructor, so you must memorize the ritual recitations. " Since I was young and had never participated in Ngor's ordination ceremony, I said I could barely manage the ritual text. During that afternoon and the next day's meditation sessions, I completely memorized everything that needed to be recited as both the novice preceptor from Butön's ritual and the full ordination assistant instructor. The next morning, in front of the assembly, I flawlessly recited all the mantras for both the novice preceptor and full ordination assistant roles, including the connecting phrases and without missing half a word, along with the eleven instructions at the end, free from any verbal mistakes and without hesitation. Omniscient Sangye Pel was extremely pleased and said to the other monks, "This must either be wisdom arising from meditation or the blessing of a tutelary deity - such a thing is impossible for others. " Later, when the Horse year began, a terrible disease spread throughout central Tibet. Due to the epidemic spreading in the monastery, the monks were unable to pursue their studies and had to focus solely on healing rituals. The two teachers and disciples maintained very strict retreat, and this Lord primarily practiced the approach practice of Hevajra and the non-elaborate practice of Yamāntaka. At the end of the Horse year, when the epidemic subsided, both teacher and disciple engaged intensively in teaching and study.

In the Sheep year, they were preparing to move to the intermediate teachings at Chuzang Monastery. The evening before they were to move the next day, this Lord was struck with a severe illness and could not move. Due to the Dharma Lord's great concern, he treated him like a precious Geshe and like a colt, constantly attending to him in his sickly state. He asked, "Have you not received any instructions at Ngor? Now maintain strict retreat boundaries. By the time I return, either be dead or be recovered!" Having given such stern advice and strong reproach, the Dharma Lord was extremely concerned. [The patient] thought, "I will not seek physicians or medical treatment for this illness. I will practice solely spiritual exercises, and by the time the teachers and disciples arrive, I will have determined whether I live or die. " Taking up the view of the inseparability of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa as his focus and meditating, his illness naturally cleared away. One night in a dream, as he was about to receive empowerment from the Dharma Lord Great Being, he had a very clear dream from the offering of the ground-entering maṇḍala up through the vase empowerment of the vajra master. At the point where it was said "Received the vase empowerment, purified bodily defilements," he awoke. Hoping the remainder would continue, he tried to return to sleep, but although sleep came, the previous dream sequence did not continue. He said it seemed the phrase "purified bodily defilements" was a sign of being freed from the illness. Then afterwards, the Dharma Lord said, "I am going to Mü to receive the remaining teachings from the Great Being. Until then, Gobo Rabjampa will act as my substitute. ".

Taking as his study text what was taught in the morning sessions, while formerly there was no custom of prostrating to one's peers, from then on it was said to also make prostrations to him. After giving detailed instructions on all that needed to be taught, he departed for Mü.

Subsequently, just as had been taught by the Omniscient Sangye Pel, this Lord tirelessly engaged in study, from the great volumes of the collections like Pāramitā, Vinaya, and Abhidharma up through counting the condensed texts. This generated tremendous understanding appropriate to each of the three levels of intelligence - superior, middling and lesser. The monks developed certainty thinking "the student is more learned than the teacher," and his fame for scholarship spread widely throughout the Land of Snows. At that time, he also gave the Yamāntaka empowerment to many monks. He also composed there the versified biography of Müchen, the praise to Omniscient Sangye Pel, the general commentary on the Three Vows, the general meaning of Prajñāpāramitā, and the Clear Elucidation of the Mother's Meaning.

The fourth section, on the biography of establishing a teaching college and spreading the doctrine, has two parts:
1. The biography of establishing the teaching college
2. The biography of spreading the doctrine

Regarding the first:
Through the power of previous excellent aspirations, whatever virtuous activities the holy ones undertake are accomplished easily and naturally since all the outer, inner and secret interdependent connections align.

Thus in the Monkey year, when about to depart from Mü after completing the teachings of Omniscient Sangye Pel, the Great Being said, "Stay longer to teach and study here."

Taking the text taught in the morning sessions as his basis for study, a directive came instructing Gobo Rabjampa to be sent upward. After Omniscient Sangye Pel arrived in Drangyul, the Lord himself went to meet the Great Being in Mü. Throughout the Bird year, he received teachings, engaged in spiritual practice, and gave some teachings to several earnest students. He also composed a commentary on the versified biography of the Great Being, the "Precious Jewel" praise, two praises to Dharma Lord Kunga Zangpo, and the ritual for bhikṣuṇī Palmo's practice of the four dharmas, as well as a resolution of controversies regarding Guhyasamāja. At that time, from Jamchen, the precious reincarnate Dharma Lord Sönam Chökyi Kunga Tashi Gyaltsen Palzang was also there receiving teachings, and they developed a very harmonious relationship. He said, "A learned geshe like yourself should engage in teaching and study that benefits the doctrine. Since there doesn't seem to be a monastery seat at Dzongkar, I have requested support from Drungchen Norzang. If he provides whatever support he can and we establish a teaching program, wouldn't that be good?" This also resonated well in the Lord's mind. After both of them made requests to the Great Being twice, in the Dog year they made excellent commitments to establish a monastic college at Nag. Then when the Dog year began, the Great Being Könchok Gyaltsen was invited to Ngamring by the mighty upholders of the doctrine, the great ruler Tai Situ Namgyal Drakpa and his sons, and this Lord also went in his retinue.

In a manner of supplemental teaching, he gave extensive explanations of the Trisamvaravibhanga to many bright scholars of Ngamring including Khenchen Sangye Pel and Sangye Özer. He also gave empowerments for Guhyasamaja, Vajrabhairava, and others, along with many practical instructions and extensive explanations of the Purification Tantra. After carefully examining the prior positions of Bodong Chögyel's "Benefitting Others' Light Rays" refutation, he composed "Dispelling Harm to Benefitting Others," a resolution of controversies regarding the Sarvavid ritual. Having carefully examined Lord Palchö's refutation of "Essential Moonlight," he composed "Illuminating the Essential Points," a resolution of those controversies. He also composed a Vajrabhairava sadhana according to the Earth tradition. At that time, based on his wisdom shining like the sun's orb in the lotus garden of the scriptural institute of North Ngamring, his excellent fame and reputation spread throughout all directions. That autumn, this Lord went to meet the great reincarnate lama at Jamchen to discuss establishing a monastic college. He then went into retreat at Serkha Ding where he performed the approaching practice of Cakrasamvara Loyipa and the practice of Guru Ratnodbhava. At the end, he also composed a supplication to Guru Ratnodbhava called "Increase of Merit. "

Then he traveled to Upper Tsang. After staying some days at Samdrup Tse, when he was traveling upward, he met someone at Yuba Dong carrying a gandi who said he was selling the gandi. Saying this was a very auspicious connection, he purchased that gandi and carried it upward.

After that, he went to Tanak Serling. The Precious Reincarnate One [sku skye rin po che] and the powerful wheel-turning king Nangso Döndrup Dorje, master and disciple, arranged favorable conditions. In the Male Fire Dog year, on the fifteenth day of the month when the star Pushya was rising, they established the monastic college together with about forty monk students, and the auspicious connections were properly arranged from the beginning. Furthermore, the Lord Precious Reincarnate sold a good horse, and from its price, one thousand measures of barley [stong ra ma] and the newly established income from the scattered old documents of Rikhü Chöde were dedicated to the dharma foundation. The first became today's continuing thousand measures of barley tradition, while the latter became the tradition of aspirational prayers of Rikhü after it came into Thubten Namgyal's possession. Although Drungchen Norzang passed away that summer, the lord of Tsang maintained his intentions and established regular provisions from Samdrup Tse for the Lord himself in the official records. He also established regular summer and winter provisions for the master, disciples and general members from Rikhü. The great official Drungchen Yungpa Tsewang provided provisions to the master and disciples who came for the autumn teachings at Dokhar in the Female Fire Pig year. After that, starting from the Rat year until there was no longer a need to supply provisions to the enemy side at Dzong Dokhar in the Female Wood Snake year, each year provisions of two khal measures of barley and excellent gifts were provided to the attendants for however many monks there were.

He offered fine food to the Drung and also provisions for the general Sangha. From the very beginning, he repeatedly received the teachings of Tsewang and Mahakala among others, and relied upon them as supreme gurus.

At the beginning of composing his monastic guidelines, he said:
"Regarding our tradition of teaching and learning - since the venerable guru Vajradhara Kunga Zangpo was very pleased with the teaching and learning of the Tripitaka, and since the great being, the great Müpa, directly commanded to establish teachings on sutra and tantra - through the patronage of Chöje Sönam Chökyi Kunga Tashi Gyaltsen Palzangpo, this was established at Tanak Serling monastery on the fifteenth day of the month when the star Pushya was rising in the Male Fire Dog year. This was done generally for the flourishing of the Buddha's teachings, particularly to prevent the essential points of the excellent philosophical tradition from declining, and for myself to habituate to the words and meaning of the scriptures. There were no other primary motivations that were non-virtuous or neutral. This can be known from how the dharma-concordant teaching and learning increased up until eight years had passed. From then until this tradition of teaching and learning continues, if I were to briefly describe the conduct of the monks residing here:
1. The lineage of blessings
2. The ultimate view  
3. The conventional philosophical tenets
4. The way of commenting on scriptures"

Having followed all sacred traditions of explanation and practice according to the teaching lineage of the glorious Sakya masters, father and son, the lords of the doctrine in the Land of Snows. Particularly, one must accomplish the study and teaching of the Tripitaka. Regarding the practical methods, one must rely on the practices as done by the two lords of scholars - Yagdrong and Drakpa Zangpo, masters of wisdom, and by my guru, the lord of speech Sangye Pel, his chief spiritual son.

The meaning of these instructions is to briefly explain: under whose patronage this monastic college was established, at what time, in what place, and for what purpose, along with the training rules.

At that time, the great scholar Chöje Namsepa said: "Last year I had a dream of what was said to be Gurmgon's encampment at the root of Draklnga. This year it turns out to be Gobo Rabjampa establishing a monastic college."

The following year, in the Pig year, when the great scholar Dönyö Pelwa strongly urged saying "Please take charge of Zilung's lord as well and combine both," he thought "What should I do?" In the Rat year, he went before the Great Being at Mü and asked for advice. The Great Being contemplated for about two days and said: "Now establish a separate monastic college. You are not a geshe who needs to depend on someone like Dönyö Pelwa." When asked "Then would it be good to focus solely on teaching the Tripitaka for two days?" he replied...

Having asked "Then would it be good to just focus on teaching the Tripitaka for two days?", he replied by citing the examples of Sapan and Buton Rinpoche, firmly establishing teachings on both sutra and tantra. Therefore, returning back, he left that instruction as it was.

Then in the Female Water Hare year, when Lord Nangso Döndrup Dorje and his disciples stayed at Dreng Gang, this Lord was invited there. They made worldly displays of respect like changing seat arrangements even more than before. Based on that year's summer provision document from Rikhü, they established in the records summer and winter provisions including two and a half khal measures of barley from Karu Teng's granary along with thal (ash) for two hundred monks, as well as provisions for the Drung. I also arrived in his presence at that time.

At that time, when Rangjönpa, Rinchen Tsepa, and Urgyan Dzongpa were composing a rebellion, the officials and ministers considered this. In the Dragon year spring, they went to reprimand Rinchen Tsepa. At that time, the great abbot himself offered the fortress estate to the governor. Although all the monastery estates belonging to the dharma center emerged unscathed according to previous customs, some monks of the dharma center and official Dönpak Pa conspired underground. During the autumn alms-gathering time, they launched an attack on the fortress. Consequently, except for a few monk officials of the three managers and one or two monks serving as attendants, all the disciples of the great abbot went into exile.

Except for about ten buildings such as the great temple, the soldiers stripped wood from all the residential buildings, including the assembly hall and lama's residence. At that time, Lord Nangso Döndrup Dorje and his siblings, along with the great minister, arrived at Rinchen Tse. At that time, while this lord was staying at Ngor, an urgent letter and messenger arrived requesting his immediate presence, so he promptly went to Serling. Then, accompanied by Kachu Zangpo Tashi, Chöje Sangrin who was serving as an attendant at that time, Denma Kachu Döndrup Yeshe, Ngari Rabjampa Namkha Gyalpo, and our group of five brothers along with attendants, he went thinking that this monastery would be offered to him. First he stayed in the northern side building. The next day, he met with the governor and went to inspect the assembly hall, finding that except for piles of earth, not a single piece of wood remained. This lord sat leaning against the wall in about the upper part of the right-side row, saying "In the future, will there be old practitioners of the great scriptural traditions sitting here like some poor teacher?" Later, after three or four years, during a general tea gathering, a Sakya Madhyamika named Drakzang was sitting there in exactly that way, which made people believe this must have been a demonstration of clairvoyance. Then, when he asked the governor what needed to be done, he was told to perform a five-day torma ritual. In a residential building inside the eastern gate of the iron fence, he performed the five-day torma ritual.

Having performed [the ritual], he departed without receiving any clear instructions. The reasons for this were: Although initially there were discussions about offering the monastery grounds, later when it came time for the destruction and liberation [of the site], they changed their stance, saying "These days the assembly hall cannot accommodate the monastic gathering, and the lama's residence cannot house lamas. It would not be good to offer it in such condition. After investigating and collecting wood for the assembly hall and making the assembly hall and lama's residence minimally habitable, then it would be good to make the offering."

In the eleventh lunar month, when the governor and ministers went to Rikhud, one day I also went following an invitation. While he was staying in a residence at Rikhud Monastery, the Kyidrong secretary Gyalpo came to deliver an order. He said, "Currently the governor and ministers are staying together at Zilnön Peu. According to the governor's order, in all circumstances - such as when the Khenpo Rabjampa came from Kham and stayed at Ngor - the great Sugata made offerings of ritual items and provided patronage. This was generally to benefit the Buddha's teachings, and specifically with the hope that here in our domain, someone would come to be the foremost teacher engaging in extensive exposition and study. Having kept this intention in mind, we did whatever service we could. Just as birds don't gather where there are no trees, I thought there needs to be an independent place for teaching and study, but until now there hasn't been a convenient opportunity to make an offering."

"Regarding me, although our governor is always engaged in military affairs, he tries not to harm monasteries and the sangha. However, due to the bad behavior of the monks at Rinchen Tse, that religious institution was destroyed, which I deeply regret now. Since just having a complete number of yellow-robed monks is not sufficient for what is needed there now for restoration, someone who can uphold the teachings through explanation and practice is required. Therefore, the monastery up there will be offered to you, so there is no need to make repeated requests - you must give your acceptance based on this single request right now."

In response to this, in accordance with the order, after expressing many ways the governor had shown kindness, he said "Now the governor has given the order with his full consideration, and since I also need a monastery, I will keep it in mind." When I responded accordingly, he was very pleased and there was much laughter.

Then on the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, along with the edict from Dharma King Döndrup Dorje, this lord was appointed to the seat. At that time, the great Tripitaka holder Kachupa Shakya Lodrö and Rabjampa Gönpo Wangchuk arose for dharma discussions. Shakya Lodrö gave vast explanations while Gönpo Wangchuk presented unequaled consequentialist arguments. This delighted all the bright students in the assembly. The lord himself then named the monastery "Thubten Namgyal" (Complete Victory of the Buddha's Teachings). After just taking preliminary administrative responsibility for the monastery, he departed.

In the second lunar month of the Water Female Snake year, when he was forty-five years old, he arrived at Thubten Namgyal. He instructed the workers to do good construction work on the common and private buildings. To some he gave land with foundations, and to others he granted plots. Regarding the assembly hall, which initially had a south-facing door, he added one pillar to the east and two pillars to the south, intending to make the door face east. We, a few Tripitaka holders, served as attendants. He performed extensive ground consecration ceremonies, and through unwavering study and diligent work on both common and private buildings, the monastery gradually flourished. 2. Regarding the liberation story of spreading the teachings, there are two parts:
2. 1. How he spread the teachings while residing at his own place
2. 2. How he spread the teachings by traveling to other places

2. 1. First, as it is said:
"Spreading the teachings through explanation, debate and composition during the day,
Meditating single-pointedly on profound yoga at night,
Never deviating from the three purities,
I bow to the root and branches of the Omniscient One's teachings. "

His daily religious activities generally followed this pattern: After completing the evening session, he would rest practicing sleep yoga. Rising early in the morning with awakening yoga, he would first perform both common and uncommon protector practices of Bir[wapa], then practice the profound guru yoga and Naro Khechari meditation. Afterward, he would perform the extensive path-time practice concluding with pranayama yoga with mantra recitation, followed by unfailing recitation of many dharani mantras including the Namgyel Joma.

Upon waking at dawn, he would briefly review the large texts to be taught that afternoon. Then, after rising and making offerings of the four white substances, he would pray. Immediately after that, when the dharma gong sounded, he would ascend to the teaching throne. He would give extensive teachings on Pramana texts, or any of the later volumes, and whatever dharma was appropriate according to the wishes of the students. Afterward, he would teach any suitable tantric dharma including tantras and oral instructions. At noon he would go inside for the midday session and meal. Right after the midday meal when the dharma gong sounded, he would again go to the teaching throne. During times when the days were short he would not give general teachings, but when the days became somewhat longer he would teach general dharma including Vinaya, Bodhicharyavatara, Shikshasamucchaya, mind training and so forth. Then he would teach a condensed meaning from the Pramana texts, or any of the later volumes, and various topics suited to the minds of students dedicated to study, including general meanings and so forth. Afterward he would also teach some extremely profound Vajrayana dharma. Then he would go inside and from the time the dharma gong sounded, he would remain single-pointedly in meditation practice. This included the extensive path-time practice, both the Krishna Chakrasamvara and Ghantapada [traditions], the Five Deity Red Yamari, extremely unelaborated yoga, path-eating, guru yoga, Naro Khechari and other meditation and mantra recitations which he practiced extensively. Afterward he would perform extensive torma offerings to the yidams and dharma protectors. Then he would perform both protector practices of Virupa. Then through sleep yoga he would enter single-pointedly into clear light.

Following the dawn yoga practices as mentioned before, in brief, at all times he never let his three doors [of body, speech and mind] remain in an ordinary state.

During teaching breaks, building upon the previous sequence of spiritual practices, he continuously turned the wheel of enlightened activities by:
1. Giving empowerments

Many question-answer sessions were given to various inquirers like the lord of scholars Musradpa Dorje Gyaltsen. He composed numerous praises to many holy beings according to individual requesters, including praises to Dagchen Chumigpa Lodrö Wangchuk and Karmapa Chödrak Gyatso. Furthermore, the number of compositions made for different individuals - including instructions to the lamas of various monasteries and local rulers, as well as dedication prayers, aspiration prayers, and verses of auspiciousness - is beyond count.

Regarding all these compositions, one should be certain that they were blessed by the gurus and yidams, and constantly protected by the dharma protectors. For instance, on the night he began composing the "Dispelling Doubts" text at Byang Ngamring, in a dream he saw a great bodhisattva with radiant dignity sitting on a large round dharma throne in the middle of bamboo trees surrounded by pure water. With a voice louder than before, he declared "Currently in snowy Tibet, there is none more learned than I in the Purification Tantra." He was teaching by systematically organizing the upper and lower texts. Thinking it unusual that such proclamations had not been made before, he listened with focused awareness.

Having found deep certainty regarding some difficult points he had not understood before, upon waking he found everything was very clear. Then he thought about it carefully. After arising, he performed some virtuous practices. When he started thinking about it again, he had forgotten. However, he said that the text turned out well.

When he began composing the supplement to the Three Vows [sdom gsum kha skong], although he did not see the face of the great bodhisattva in his dream, a great voice came saying "Compose the text with diligence. It will benefit the teachings." He said that at that time he thought it was a text on logic.

In the dream when he began composing the general commentary on logic [tshad ma'i spyi don], there was someone called Lama Lhoring and someone singing the song of non-conceptuality. They said Mahakala [gdong bzhi pa] was coming, and the whole world became chaotic. All the valleys turned pitch black. There were many frightening people wearing black armor. He could not look directly at his form. Looking from the corner of his eye, he saw that he wore iron boots with leather leggings. From the knees down he appeared taller than a one-story house. He could not look above that.

He said that similar dreams occurred at the beginning of most of his compositions, but did not occur when composing the Questions and Answers on the Three Vows. This account is what I heard directly, and although I heard from holy friends about many other amazing dreams, I have not written them here.

Furthermore, he possessed clairvoyant knowledge of what could be known through contemplation. In the Female Water Hare year, when Pondrung Yungpa led the great army of Shigatse Rinpungpa with plans to expel the people of Gyantse, whoever came before this lord would ask "Will they be able to expel the Gyantse people this year or not?"

When everyone asked him whether the people of Gyantse would be expelled that year, with a gentle smile and nodding his head he said, "Just watch and see. They will not be able to expel the Gyantse people this year. Though some say their merit is exhausted and their conduct is wrong, the conduct of the Gyantse people remains undiminished." Later, everything happened exactly as he had said.

When Pondrung was imprisoned at Gyantse, one day this lord said, "Although I don't have clairvoyance, whenever I have a deep intuition that something might be this way or that way, it turns out exactly like that." When I asked, "So will Pondrung be released from prison?" He definitively said "No." Although at that time I was somewhat uncertain, later upon reflection, I developed deep conviction that he possessed clairvoyance.

For these reasons, I prostrate to the all-knowing Sonam Senge, who received blessings from the gurus possessing the three trainings, who cut through the web of doubts through special deities, and who respectfully received prophecies from the ocean of dharma protectors.

Regarding his manner of debate: During the occasions of those earlier teachings and compositions, he would first fully present the opposing positions exactly as they were in others' texts. Then, by clearly demonstrating how they contradicted scripture, reasoning, and their own assertions, he would defeat the power of others' wrong views and generate certainty in intelligent followers who came after him. Since this was comprehensive, it need not be mentioned separately.

Those teachings and compositions he gave were also non-contradictory with common traditions and

Having completed all the common and uncommon teachings and compositions in a non-contradictory way, their ability to make beginners understand easily while captivating and humbling even long-trained scholars is established through experience.

2. Regarding how he spread the teachings after going to other places, there are two parts:
2.1 How he spread the teachings while serving as abbot at Ewam Choden
2.2 How he spread the teachings while traveling to other places

2.1 First: In the Iron Female Ox year, when the great master Lodro Wangchuk passed away, the sangha from all three places - Ngor, Zi, and Lung - were invited for the memorial ceremonies. At that time, Choje Palden Dorje served as abbot, Choje Shakya Chogden as karma master, and this lord as secret preceptor, ordaining Drolmawa Choje Sonam Palchog and others. 

Immediately after that was completed, he went to Ewam Choden where, with Choje Palden Dorje as abbot, this lord as karma master, and Lopon Sonam Sangye as secret preceptor, they ordained Choje Konchog Pelwa and others. That autumn, when Choje Palden Dorje resigned from his position as abbot and departed for Sakya, during that winter a Ngorpa representative named Thubten Namgyal came and requested this lord, saying "Please primarily serve as the abbot of Ewam Choden, or if that is not possible, at least serve as acting abbot for a few years and definitely give some teachings from the Path and Fruit tradition." Considering this request, this lord thought...

In considering this master's intentions: Since the monastic assembly at Thubten Namgyal was flourishing and continuous teachings on sutra and tantra were needed, although going to Ngor would harm this situation, and although the previous master had not properly maintained the monastery, thinking it would be unacceptable if it declined, he disregarded his own monastery and agreed to serve as acting abbot. During the interim dharma session at Dokhar, he went to Ewam Choden. In the Tiger year, he served as acting abbot, rang the gong, and gave teachings on the Path and Fruit and other dharmas. Then on the fifth day of the first lunar month of the Female Water Hare year, he arrived at the seat of Ewam Choden and stayed for four years until the Male Fire Horse year.

In the letter encouraging dharma activities in the Kham region, the master said: "Although we have established strong teaching and study of sutra and tantra, primarily focused on the Tripitaka, at Thubten Namgyal monastery at Rinchen Tse in Tanag, since all the senior Ngor teachers and monk officials strongly insisted that I must serve as abbot and I could not refuse, and remembering the incomparable kindness of even just a portion of how the master and his disciples served the Buddha's teachings, although there were no definite signs of what would happen here in the future, I found no other option and could not give it up mentally. Therefore, I took on the responsibility of abbot from the fifth day of the first lunar month of the Hare year."

While the lord was residing at Ngor, Soelpon Gedun Zangpo managed the labrang. Kachupa Sonam Gyatso and Rabjampa Thukje Palzang...

While the lord was residing at Ngor, Soelpon Gedun Zangpo managed the labrang. When Kachupa Sonam Gyatso, Rabjampa Thukje Palzang, and I engaged in teaching and study, it became equivalent to when the lord himself was present, which was certainly accomplished through the lord's kindness.

During those times, first at Thubten Namgyal during the first winter dharma session, he performed the ritual recitations, arranged the establishment of teachings, and gave necessary advice and instructions. Then, traveling from Shabme via the interim dharma session at Dokhar, he arrived at Ewam Choden and taught countless profound and vast dharmas of the Vajrayana, beginning with the precious Path and Fruit teachings. He repeatedly gave the Mahayana bodhicitta according to the Madhyamaka tradition and Mahayana mind training. He fulfilled all the wishes of countless aspirants who came from all directions through ordination, full ordination and so forth. After completing the ritual offerings for the time of Lord Vajradhara, he returned again to Thubten Namgyal and taught profound and vast dharmas to countless devoted and intelligent disciples.

Then during the earth offering ceremony of the ninth lunar month, he went to Ewam Choden where he performed extensive periodic offerings and taught dharmas appropriate to each individual. Then in the tenth lunar month he went to Thubten Namgyal, where after extensively performing the annual memorial offerings for Muchen Konchog Gyaltsen, the sequence of establishing the first winter teachings and so forth was as before.

Moreover, during his residence at Ewam Choden, abundant offerings like rainfall were made by fortunate disciples with faith from Central Tibet, Tsang, the Three Provinces, and Ngari. Without taking any of these for his own use, he applied them to the monastery's necessities and sent offerings designated for the twenty-fifth day and first day ceremonies as religious encouragement to the Kham region. Having ensured these reached Ewam Choden in that same Horse Year when the monastery was established, he thus rendered great service and kindness to Ewam Choden. Then in the male Fire Horse year, after the Speech Liberation teachings, Lord Dharma Konchog Pelwa was enthroned at the monastery seat. After giving necessary advice and instructions, he arrived at Thubten Namgyal during the Saga month (fourth lunar month) where he propagated the teachings through explanation and practice. 2. The way he spread the teachings by going to other places for dharma sessions:
In the male Fire Dog year, the year after establishing the monastic college, he conducted the spring dharma session at Drakmar Chode. For the autumn session of that year, he went to Dokhar. Then in the spring of the Rat year, he held a dharma session at Dokhar, after which he also went to pay respects to the Great Siddha at Mu. Then for the summer session, he went to the great monastic college of Jamchen where he turned the vast wheel of dharma. Then in the spring of the Ox year, he went to Dokhar where he composed the root text of "Mandala of Maitreya" and "Essential Amrita of Profound Meaning. " The commentary was composed later when he arrived at Thubten Namgyal.

2. 1. Then, in both the Tiger and Dragon years, he conducted a dharma session at Gawa Tshal during each year, and in the first year he also composed a praise to Tara. During those two years except for the Hare year, he did not conduct dharma sessions anywhere other than at Dokhar. 2. 2. From the female Water Snake year until the male Fire Monkey year - a period of four years - he traveled back and forth between Thubten Namgyal and Serling, while also conducting annual dharma sessions at Dokhar. At the end of the female Wood Sheep year, while at Dokhar, he was preparing to go to Trophu for the prayer festival and was collecting butter lamps, general tea offerings and other provisions. 2. 3. However, due to concerns about possible disturbances from Yungpa Tsewang, the people of Tromda did not let him go. During that year, conflicts arose in Shab Med, and the people of Tromda fled their homeland. 2. 4. In autumn of that year, when Trophu Chöje Sangye Darwe requested to offer general tea, the Lord replied, "Since we will hold the prayer festival at Trophu this year, prepare the general tea offering then. "

2. 5. Then in the twelfth lunar month of that year, he traveled from Dokhar to Trophu where he stayed for two days. With three general tea offerings - one from Trophu Chöje and one each from the general administration - he established a great prayer festival. 2. 6. Then in the male Earth Dog year, he formed the intention to go to the great monastic seat of glorious Sakya for a dharma session. He established a fifteen-day dharma session at Dokhar, collected half the provisions, and departed on the ninth day. He went to pay respects to the great master Lodro Wangchuk at Shab Med. The next morning, all the teachers and students requested teachings on Manjushri Arapacana and the Thubten Serkhang traditions.

That evening he went to Trophu, offered butter lamps and made extensive prayers. At that time, although the people of Tromda had settled in their homes, the patron-priest relationship had not been settled. The next morning he departed, and stayed one night each at Zhalkar Lhadong and Zhonga. Around noon on the thirteenth day, he arrived near the great monastic seat of glorious Sakya. At that time, many senior monks led by Master Rabjampa Jampa Senge came to welcome him. The Lord said, "Since we are distinguished guests of the monastic seat, dismount from your horses. " So we also dismounted from our horses while they were making prostrations. Then when visiting the great temple and assembly hall, all teachers and students dismounted and prostrated fully. At that time, due to the power of his vast fame, all the lay and ordained people from the surrounding area gathered. Although it seemed impossible to escape from the crowd of blessing-seekers due to their vast numbers, the monks who had gone ahead joined hands to form a barrier and protected him, allowing everyone to receive blessings while keeping him safe. Then first he went to Dzongchung where he had tea served. Then he made the eastern residence building his quarters. The next day, on the fourteenth, excellent general tea was prepared as an offering for Sakya Pandita's memorial service. Offerings were made to the presence of the precious great master Sherab Gyaltsen who had returned from India, and proper arrangements were made for each of the various lamas including the commanders.

Moreover, to each monk he presented row offerings of ceremonial scarves and envelopes. For the first of two dharma sessions there, provisions were offered by Lhedzongpa. For the second session, some prominent attendants of the Great Temple encouraged monks to make offerings. Throughout the dharma sessions, both morning and evening, without diminishing the teachings and study of sutra and tantra, the wealthy residents there would regularly invite about thirty teachers and students, both morning and evening, for meals. Since there were many such invitations, all the teachers and students offered whatever butter and melted butter they received for butter lamps. Many others also offered butter lamps both collectively and individually, so that later it was said, "The butter lamps were excellent that year, and from then on the tradition of butter lamps improved."

He regularly made offerings and prayers before famous sacred objects like the Old Upper Temple and Great Temple, and made torma offerings and performed activities at famous protector chapels like Gorum. During the dharma breaks, when requested by the assembly, he gave extensive offerings of barley and other items. To all the patrons and attendants, both high and low, who were present there, he gave the bodhisattva vows of the Mahayana. To those led by Master Sangye Gyatso, he gave empowerments and permissions for Yamantaka, Vajrabhairava and others as appropriate, thus satisfying their wishes.

Then he also went to Khauke Lhesu. There, he met with Sachen Lodro Gyaltsen Pelzangpo who was in strict retreat at Phagpa Dragkhung, and they had many discussions. He also received the permissions for Dud Gyel and Karmo Nyizla, and I too received just the prostration empowerment. That evening, at the shrine of Four-Faced Mahakala, he performed extensive torma offerings and fulfillment rituals. During the fulfillment ritual, a consecrated arrow-banner fell there, and when this was reported to the great master, he said "Since this is a sign that Mahakala will grant accomplishments, you may keep it." It was exchanged for a black happiness banner, and that banner was kept and exists today among the hanging banners.

At that time, the great master said that while there was an explanation of the code words of the first verse that comes at the end of the Stong thun outline chapter, which begins "The unsurpassed direction is that which transforms aspects, having eyes..." there had not previously been explanations of the code words for the remaining verses, so he asked me to consider it carefully. I replied that I had not previously considered it carefully.

Then when he went to Sakya, the statue of Jetsun made by Nare Je Shinje Drag was invited to the eastern palace building. He made extensive offerings and prayers for seven days, after which he said the realization had arisen naturally. He then composed "The Joy-Giving Certainty of Code Word Explanation," for which I was the scribe.

Furthermore, the lord of scholars Musradpa Dorje Gyaltsen, along with the leader of one hundred from Drangmoche, invited him to the Drangmoche palace building where they served him well. There were also many excellent conversations.

And later, he went to Thubten Namgyal where many discerning questions were presented regarding doubts about the teachings of the previous venerable master. He generated certainty through answers consistent with the previous master's teachings. Moreover, while residing at the great monastic seat along with Chadab, all the monks and laypeople regarded him as the actual Buddha and approached him with their various wishes - some for taking refuge, some for abandoning killing, some for novice or full ordination, some requesting bodhicitta and empowerments. In brief, he fulfilled all their individual wishes, and through giving temporary vows, commitments to the six-syllable mantra, and even through protective cords and blessed water, he accomplished immeasurable benefit for beings, which brought satisfaction to the master's mind. As it is said: "Most actions are meaningless or meaningful, and some are always meaningful, but protector, all your actions are definitely meaningful in every way. "

Then on the fifteenth day of the Miracle Month, in the morning, in front of Venerable Manjushri, he extensively performed the Madhyamaka bodhicitta ceremony and aspirations for all the assembled people. In the evening, he also gave the permission of Orange Manjushri to the monks who were present for the aspiration prayers. The next day was intended for departure, but due to the Sakya officials requesting a farewell tea, there was a delay. Then on the seventeenth, he departed and stayed in Lhasa that night. The next day he went to Dongkha.

Invited by Tashi Dzompa, [the master] had a discussion with an excellent spiritual friend named Chöje Pallegpa, who was an attendant of Thegchen Chökyi Gyalpo. The next day, he was invited to Zhichen, and after having lunch, he made aspirations before the statue of Noble Rinpoche. In the afternoon, he went to Lugru Ganden where, led by Chöje Södgönpa, the monks of this monastery made virtuous requests and arranged provisions for ten days, and teachings were also established. At that time, Mangkhar Samdrubpa invited the general assembly of monks, and [the master] stayed for two days. He went to Myugu Lung and made extensive butter lamp offerings and aspirations before the statue of Drogmi Lotsawa. During the break between teachings, at the intermission, he was invited to Darpa Nangsö Dar. He fully ordained one abbot of the monastery who was a Darpa official and one Dharma teacher from Zurtso. The next day, a select group of teachers and students were invited to both Tsopo and Lhatse. At the sacred objects and protector chapel of Lhatse, he performed extensive observations, aspirations, and torma offerings. That day, he went to Sagthang Ding, made extensive offerings and aspirations at the stupa of Jangönpawa, and stayed there that night. The next day, he arrived at Jonang Dar. We, the Jonang followers, went to circumambulate the stupa and make aspirations. Then gradually he arrived at Thubten Namgyal. At that time, the local people...

At that time, when the local people requested, "We need [the bodhicitta ceremony] just as you performed at Sakya," he conducted, from the Trisamvara dharma throne, an extensive Madhyamaka bodhicitta ceremony for all the assembled people, and properly performed extensive auspicious aspiration prayers for both immediate and long-term benefit. After the dharma session at Dokhar at the end of that year, based on the virtuous encouragement of Gawa Dewa Tapon Chopa, the patron Chökyong Bo of Palding invited [the master]. In the first month of the Rat year, [the master] was invited to Trophu and conducted a one-month dharma session. The dharma teachings and aspiration prayers increased tremendously. This was the first dharma session at Trophu. At that time, after paying respects to Tromda Zhikhawa who was residing at Yangtsé, [the master] went to Trophu to make offerings. He offered one good throne cushion and a threshold beam to the sangha. He also made a commitment to establish regular monastic classes starting from the Ox year. Then, after the dharma session at Dokhar at the end of that same year, in the first month of the Ox year, Tromda and Chökyong Bo each offered half the provisions and established a dharma session at Trophu. In connection with that, from Singshö, the Kachupa Sönam Gyaltsen brothers also offered provisions. From the female Iron Ox year until the female Earth Bird year - a period of nine years - Tromda and Chökyong Bo together sponsored dharma sessions. At the end of that Ox year, starting from the dharma session at Dokhar, in the Tiger year, they departed for Ngor to receive the Lamdré teachings from the Omniscient Rinpoche. I and my dharma siblings, leading others, went to Berchen.

After that Ox year's final dharma session at Dokhar, in the first month of the Tiger year, the Omniscient Rinpoche again departed for Ngor, and the monks went to Berchen. That summer, invited by Bodongpa, traveling via Shabmé, he arrived at Bodong for a dharma session. The assembly of monks was extremely large, and it was as if there was a competition between the rain of dharma and the rain of flowers, becoming a place of offering for all gods and humans. At Chakö Shong, he made extensive offerings before the Jowo statue and made vast aspiration prayers. During that female Water Hare year, this master was invited by Dharma King Döndrup Dorje to Samdrub Tse, where he received many teachings including the long-life empowerment and Mahakala instructions, and he regarded him as supreme among all the lamas. After that year's dharma session at Dokhar, in the Dragon year, the Omniscient Rinpoche departed for Ngor. I and my dharma siblings, leading others, went to Berchen. Afterwards, invited by Bodongpa, he also established one dharma session at Chakö Shong. That summer, invited by the Dharma King, the great master Namkha Dorje and his spiritual sons to Ja'ang Tshang, he established two dharma sessions. Through empowerments of Chakrasamvara and Yamantaka and others, as well as through instructions on simplicity and other teachings, he satisfied the disciples. At that time as well, there appeared to be a continuous rain of great flowers. At the end of that year, the master himself departed from Thubten Namgyal to Ngor. I and my dharma siblings, leading others, went to Dokhar, and that was the final dharma session at Dokhar.

In the first month of the Snake year, he went to Khropur for the dharma session. After completing the winter dharma session that year at Thubten Namgyal, in the first month of the Horse year, I and my dharma siblings, leading others, went to Khropur for the dharma session. After that year's completion of the Ngor ritual ceremony, having transferred authority of the seat, the master himself arrived at Thubten Namgyal in the Saga month. Soon after, invited by the Dechen Khenpo, he proceeded to Chum Dechen with about one hundred monks who were eager for the dharma teachings. He turned the wheel of profound and vast dharma teachings including the precious Word [gsung ngag], thereby ripening countless disciples for the Mahayana and making the doctrine gentle and pure. Then in the seventh month, invited by the great northern lord and his sons to Ja'ong Tshang, he turned the wheel of dharma for one month. At that time, there were over six hundred monks, and about three hundred copies of Prajnaparamita texts were distributed. At the end of that year, invited by Bodongpa, he traveled via Dzila. After staying for two nights, he arrived at Bodong and resided at the Blue Fort [sngon mo rdzong]. At that time, after receiving offerings of ceremonial tea, he made a brief visit to Ngor and returned again to the same place, where he turned the wheel of dharma according to what was appropriate for each person. Subsequently, in the first month of the Sheep year, he went to Khropur, made extensive butter lamp offerings before the Venerable One, and performed teachings and aspiration prayers as if in competition.

In that year's summer, at the invitation of the northern master, he went to Ja'ong Tshang for the dharma session and performed innumerable virtuous deeds benefiting the doctrine and sentient beings. Then in the first Hor month of the Monkey year, he went to Khropur for the dharma session and aspiration prayers. After that, invited by Gyakharwa, he conducted a dharma session at Jad Gangkhar. Then he went to Khropur for the elderly Khromda'wa's funeral rites and performed extensive aspiration prayers. That summer at Thubten Namgyal, the gathering for the Lamdre teachings was so large that people had to be arranged outside the assembly hall on stones. At that time, when it was mentioned that he should proceed to Sakya for the dharma session, I requested, "Since your health has been weak since last year, and since faithful disciples with good karma are coming here, wouldn't it be better to stay here and extend the dharma session?" He replied, "This year, whatever happens, I will go to Sakya to make extensive butter lamp offerings before the Venerable Manjushri and perform aspiration prayers, and make extensive torma offerings before Mahakala. On the return journey, I will go to Dzongkar to make whatever offerings of gold and silver I can for the construction of the precious master's silver stupa, and to offer a communal tea ceremony.

Having stayed here for three days as you suggested, afterwards I needed to go to Central Tibet for some dharma-related work. Although I could not attend the intermediate dharma session, I heard the following from trusted friends: He visited Ngor for a session. On his return journey, he performed ritual prayers and dharma recitations for several days at Thubten Namgyal. Then he departed for the first winter dharma session at Khropur. After about fifteen days of teaching, when he intended to return to the main seat, the following situation arose: At that time, Don Phagpa was residing at Dradrinchen and Senge Tse. At both places, a couple of bad people, relying on the fact that Gobo Rabjampa and his disciples were sent to Sakya for the intermediate session while Zhikhawa was making torma offerings and giving instructions, presented reasons that it would be good to prevent [his travel] since harm would come to the eastern and western peaks. Both places sent sealed messages attempting to prevent the intermediate session. [He responded]: "My going to Sakya for this intermediate session is not only for Zhikhawa's torma offerings and rituals. Generally, it is to benefit the doctrine and sentient beings. Particularly, I cannot bear to see the great turmoil of these times, so I am going to pray for peace and happiness to come to the kingdom after this conflict ends." After explaining these reasons in detail, permission was later granted to return to the main seat. With about five hundred monks, he departed from Khropu on the eighth day and arrived at the great seat on the tenth. On the fourteenth, during the special occasion, he offered communal tea and made distributions of one zho of gold each to groups of twelve monks, and offered about five hundred khal of butter for continuous butter lamps. He stayed in the chambers of the Mahayana Dharma King in the old central tower. He conducted two teaching sessions - the first was sponsored by Lhachenpa and the latter by Lhasawa.

The gatherings of people, individual offerings from resident patrons, teachings, aspiration prayers, torma offerings and such occurred much like during the intermediate sessions. In particular, he bestowed the Cakrasamvara Dakini Ocean empowerment, empowerments of Guhyasamaja Manjuvajra and others, the oral transmission of his own extensive commentary on the major consecration ritual, and the authorization of Iron Sword Hayagriva and other practices to many high lamas and important people including the crown ornament of beings, the great master Sonam Gyaltsen Palzang. Through giving the Four Attachments instruction and the Green Tara authorization to all those gathered there, and through countless other virtuous deeds, he planted seeds of liberation in immeasurable disciples.

At that time, from the offerings of the faithful, immeasurable quantities of barley and copper cloth were received. These were entrusted with strict instructions to the fourth-floor manager and the three leaders of tens and other officials for repairs of the outer and inner supports of the previous lamas' [shrine] in the old central tower.

Then, in his sixty-first year, on the eighth day of the first month of the female earth-bird year, he departed from the great seat and stayed at a monastery in Rasa. The next day he went to Naza Dragphug for pilgrimage, where he offered butter lamps and made extensive aspiration prayers.

Then, after receiving the remaining portion of the previous allowance at Khropu and making aspiration prayers, although he had a strong wish to go to Thubten, because of Bodong's intense requests...

Then, due to Bodong's intense requests, he went to Ngonmo Dzong that evening and established a fifteen-day dharma session. On the eighteenth day, from atop the dharma throne, speaking in a manner of using signs and words, some gathered there said he should be taken to the main seat. When he said "That will not happen" and spoke many other things that some understood and some did not, everyone in the dharma assembly became uncertain. That afternoon, when several officials from Senge Tse offered many tea services, it seemed to trigger something, and at midnight his health declined and he developed a severe illness. The next day, although efforts were made for his recovery through complete renunciation ceremonies and distribution of general tea offerings and such, as the karmic connection of disciples in this realm was exhausted, and since he himself had begun aspiration prayers for Sukhavati since the female sheep year, having also made the monks repeatedly recite aspiration prayers, he seemed to be directing his intention toward departing for Sukhavati. His health continued to decline, and at dawn on the twenty-first, he asked "Is it the twenty-first today?" When those present responded affirmatively, he said "It seems I am like Master Kunga Wangchuk. I need to reach Thubten Namgyal," and entered the time of spiritual practice. Having perfectly meditated on the samadhi of the generation and completion stages and performed recitations, at that very moment, he lay back on his pillow and departed for Sukhavati while resting in meditative equipoise on the bridge of the moment of death. Alas! Alas! The holy father-master has departed to the pure realm, leaving behind countless disciples.

After we lost our guide, who will give hope to those without protection, like merchants who have lost their captain in the ocean? Now that the sun of the Buddha's doctrine has set, who will open the lotus garden of hundreds of sutra and tantra texts? Who will show the excellent unmistaken path of the three vehicles? Today, darkness has fallen upon the land of Tibet. Although it is said this body is of the nature of earth, upon examination, I understand it to be of the nature of water. If not so, from what other water source could these streams of tears flow? However, when contemplating the guru's instructions, within the naturally manifest celestial palace of one's own body, in the moon disc residing in the eight-petaled heart, the glorious guru, the mighty vajra holder, eternally dwells radiantly for the faithful ones. Therefore, what was taught about being inseparable - the essence of the dharma nectar of definitive meaning - has today become the nectar of our life force. Then after two days had passed, when the holy remains were transported to Thubten Namgyal by two intermediaries, just as preparations were being made for the cremation, unprecedented whirlwinds arose as a sign of the displeasure of dakinis and dharma protectors. Many inauspicious events occurred, such as the gold decorations and wooden ornaments of the labrang and assembly hall being shaken and falling into the street. Therefore, unable to perform the immediate cremation, they temporarily enshrined the remains in the form of a stupa. The next day, extraordinary signs continuously appeared, such as a completely clear sky and a canopy of rainbows.

Then, in front of those remains, Dharma Lord Zhonnu Gyalchok and a group of four monks headed by his reincarnation established the sadhana and offering practice of Hevajra, which continued uninterruptedly until the cremation of the holy remains. Starting from the day after the arrival of the holy remains, they began methods to fulfill his wishes. The labrang itself took primary responsibility, while devoted patrons and monks provided additional support from various quarters. For one month, they arranged two daily meals and without fail provided morning and evening tea. In the mornings, the sangha performed one round of Medicine Buddha practice. At noon, they performed extensive prayers including guru puja, supplications, and aspirations such as the Samantabhadra prayer. In the following month, they provided at minimum one meal and one general tea offering without fail, and continued the meditation practices as before. During breaks, they put great effort into laying the stone floors and foundations of the shrine room housing the inner sacred objects. Furthermore, they seem to have made excellent distributions of barley and other provisions to all, both lay and ordained. Then I also arrived. After consultations with those in authority, an invitation was sent to Dharma Lord Ngor, who arrived and stayed at the labrang. Around that time, five Nepalese craftsmen - master and disciples - arrived. At that time, Steward Gedun Zangpo took charge of all internal responsibilities including attending to the Dharma Lord and hosting the craftsmen. With mutual support and assistance from all dharma brothers, we gradually began preparations for creating an inner sacred object - a thirteen-cubit-high golden buddha statue.

After meditating on the inner sacred objects, Lord Dharma commissioned their construction and continuously prepared the consecration materials. He also gave some dharma teachings to those who were interested in tantric teachings. We dharma brothers also provided whatever assistance was needed and gave some teachings. Then at dawn on the twenty-first day of the eighth lunar month, Dharma Lord Konchok Pelwa himself performed the ritual and offered the holy remains to the fire. Auspicious signs appeared that became objects of faith for people, including: white-colored flames, beautiful shapes in the stupas and conch shells, pleasant sounds, and a net of light covering the sky. When they opened the cremation chamber on the full moon day, the skull had remained intact. Many relics appeared from the holy remains and cremation ashes, which were distributed to various devoted followers. The intact skull was placed in the heart center of the inner sacred objects. I personally mixed one portion of the remains with clay from Dzasa and molded about seven hundred large tsha-tshas, which were then distributed. These were made containing the essence of whichever of the four great dharanis was appropriate, colored with the five buddha family colors, wrapped in maroon and yellow cloth, and installed from the navel down. One portion of the bone relics was made into tsha-tshas containing dharani essences and later installed inside the outer sacred objects. The remaining bone relics were molded into statues of Manjushri using clay from Dzasa. After gilding and consecrating these, they were widely distributed as objects of devotion to all faithful ones throughout the Land of Snows, continuing up to the present day.

Then the craftsmen completed the construction of the sacred objects with great success. On the waxing phase of the ninth lunar month, Dharma Lord Ngor himself performed the ritual and properly installed the dharani contents of the inner sacred objects in sequence. From the ninth day onwards, Dharma Lord Nyentshab and our group of teachers and students served Dharma Lord Ngor. They performed the sadhana and offering rituals based on the painted mandala of Hevajra, and conducted the preparatory rituals for consecration. Early the next morning, they began the actual sequence of meditation practices, and when the sun rose over the assembly hall, they scattered flowers over the sacred objects. At that time, the scattering of long-life blessing flowers and the sun's rays shining through the eastern window of the pure chamber onto the heart of the sacred object occurred simultaneously - an extremely auspicious connection. That morning, the labrang offered tea and gifts to the assembled sangha, and made extensive offerings to the public as well. At noon, Inner Rinchen Tsepa respectfully offered excellent tea and gifts, and all the teachers and students filled the space with extensive verses of auspiciousness and well-wishing in unison. At that time, led by the great officials and their students, they honored the craftsmen with gifts, criticisms, and provisions in an excellent manner, making them happy, pleased and delighted. Following the consecration, due to the extremely mild weather conditions, the people of Tanak Phu Valley discussed how, since the consecration of the inner sacred objects at Thubten Namgyal went well, this absence of wind indicated there would be no external battles that year.

On the completion of these memorial ceremonies up until the consecration of the inner sacred objects, Dharma Lord Konchok Pelwa showed great kindness to Thubten Namgyal and then proceeded to the sacred grounds of Ewam Choden. 5. The liberation story of uninterrupted enlightened activities:

When people gathered to discuss who would be suitable for the throne holder position, most of the sangha said Dharma Lord Minyakpa would be suitable since he was in harmony with Dharma Lord Kunkhyen, was learned in dharma, and was a lama of the district. One group of monks and my two friends said, "Since Dharma Lord Minyakpa does not have Kunkhyen Rinpoche's dharma lineage, he is not suitable for this throne. If he is appointed to the throne by any means, we will stay here." Both made these statements and blocked that possibility.

Subsequently, many monks said that since during Kunkhyen Rinpoche's time, Dharma Lord Ngor had been invited to teach dharma from this throne, he would be suitable for the position. Since no one could say he was unsuitable, they submitted a concordant letter to the district official. The official also issued an order that he must take the throne position.

While the general public was insisting on submitting requests, I also arrived. Although all of us dharma brothers submitted our reasons why he must take the throne position, the Dharma Lord did not give even a hint of acceptance. Then Drung Murampa...

After that, Drung Murampa declared, "If Dharma Lord Ngor does not take the throne position, I will not stay here" and departed towards the western direction on a full moon night of the seventh lunar month. Then, in order to make arrangements according to everyone's unanimous agreement, immediately after the consecration ceremony by Dharma Lord Ngor, a group led by Drung Kachu, Dharma Lord Nyentshab, and myself presented a sealed petition regarding the throne appointment, stating we would respect whatever Dharma Lord Ngor decided. Although this seemed like it would work out smoothly, nothing concrete came of it. Subsequently in winter, a delegation led by Drung Kachu traveled to petition the governor at Samdrub Tse with their sealed documents. At that time, Drung Kachu, having changed his previous position, submitted reasons why Dharma Lord Minyakpa would be suitable for this throne. Based on this, the governor also sent a letter, and although the officials and their students made earnest requests and I too submitted an urgent petition agreeing that he should come to take the throne, they returned without any clear commitment.

After that, when the governor learned that Dharma Lord Minyakpa was physically unable to come there, he sent an official letter stating that they needed to dissolve the teacher-patron relationships and make new arrangements for the throne appointment. Following this, Drung Kachu came to me and said, "From the very beginning, you were the suitable one for this throne and also the intended focus of his wishes, but last year when you went to Central Tibet, that didn't work out well."

When Drung Kachu said, "You were the suitable one for this throne and also the intended focus of his wishes, but last year when you went to Central Tibet, that didn't work out well. Now you must take the throne position. I will also serve you in whatever way possible," I replied, "Please do not say such things. In general, with the Dharma Lord Rinpoche no longer present, and with Drung Murampa having withdrawn since last year, and with those remaining here having different wishes at this time, whoever gets the throne position - it would be by circumstance, not by merit. Please request Drung-pa to take the throne position, and I will serve him. Or gather some worthy candidates and examine them. If it falls to me, I will have no choice but to accept it."

However, he proceeded to make requests to Nangpa Lhunpoba as he had told me, and also submitted a petition to the governor. Consequently, on the tenth day of the middle summer month (the sixth Hor month) in the Iron Male Dog year, Dharma King Dondrub Dorje bestowed the appointment letter along with excellent gifts, and I was escorted to the throne and given the title of throne holder.

After that, I began activities while making single-pointed supplications to the Lord Guru. First, in the Pig year, during the Miracle Month, Rinchen Tsepa established regular monthly wages for all the teachers and students, accepted the throne, offered excellent feast offerings and excellent butter lamps as inner offerings, and established regular prayer sessions. Simultaneously, from the north, the lord and officials offered many female yaks designated for butter lamps and established pastoral communities. The governor of Senge Tse established regular patronage for the intermediate Dharma sessions, and many other faithful patrons came forward to serve, and many people came to serve as attendants.

Making meritorious offerings such as the throne back for inner supports, stupas for outer supports, and tea offerings for the twenty-first day ceremonies became easily accomplished.

I also gave teachings on sutra and tantra, primarily focusing on the Tripitaka, based on the excellent oral instructions of Kunkhyen Rinpoche, striving with two qualities: explaining according to the disciples' capacities and making excellent explanations. Due to this, the monastic assembly greatly increased, and most turned their minds toward Dharma with great development of understanding. Due to the power of many qualified geshes emerging who could work for the teachings, we now have no need to be ashamed before our predecessors. This is not due to our own power or other agents, but undoubtedly due solely to the compassion and enlightened activity of Lord Guru Kunkhyen Rinpoche.

Not only did the teachings flourish here alone, but nowadays throughout the Land of Snows, learned and disciplined direct and indirect disciples of this Lord pervade and work for the teachings. To briefly mention just a rough outline of their activities: Born in the pure lineage of the Khon family, first thoroughly studying sutra and tantra under the Lord himself, then becoming the holder of the Zhitok seat, currently residing as the protector of beings at the border of Tibet and China is Master Sonam Gyaltsen Palzang.

Furthermore, in spreading the teachings in glorious Sakya: Dharma Lord Gonpo Wangchuk and others; in the north at Ngamring, headed by Khenpo Jangsemspa, many senior Sakya spiritual friends who were direct disciples of this Lord; at Mu, Dharma Lord Tsultrim Zangpo known as Chentshapa and others; at Ngari Glowo, Tengchen Khenpo Drung Konchok Chokyab; at Dolpo, Jatsang Khenpo Rabjampa Gonpo Zangpo; in Guge, Zhide Dharma Lord and others; at Jad, Dharma Lord Thukje Palzang who established Thubten Yangpachen Monastery which continues to exist today. At the Great Monastic College, Dharma Lord Chokyong Gyaltsen as abbot; in the direction of Dritsam, Dharma Lord Kunga Chokden; at the Second Great Seat E-wam Choden, Dharma Lord Konchok Pelwa; at Gawa Dong, Dharma Lord Rinchen Palzang; at Pel Khor Dechen, Acting Abbot Dharma Lord Gedun Pel; at Taklung Nakar, Khenpo Dharma Lord Drakpa Yeshe; at Chum Dechen, Khenpo Namkha Palkyong; at Chokhor Gang, the seat holder Dharma Lord Sherab Rinchen who is the reincarnation of Panchen Sherrin; at Tibet's Vajrasana Sangphu Neutok, the Lower College seat holder Dharma Lord Kunga Paljor and the Upper College seat holder Dharma Lord Gyalwa; at glorious Nalanda, seat holder Dharma Lord Sangrinpa; at Yang Dak Kong-yul, Rabjampa Sonam Tenzin who maintains the teaching and study traditions; in the region of Zi in Dokham, Dharma Lord Kunga Dawa and Dharma Lord Shakya Lodro along with their disciples, who extensively spread the teaching and study of sutra and tantra.

At Cama, Khenpo Rabjampa Lhawang Lodro; in the region of Nyakre, Lama Gedun Senge; in Bon region, his younger brother Lekpa Gyaltsen; at Drakdeu, Khenpo Ponpo Jamyang Pal and Kachu Lodro Gyatso and others; at Khangpo Chepa, Kachu Tsultrim Ozer and others; in the region of Rongpo, Rongpo Jozang; in the region of Denma, Kachu Sherab Senge and others. These mentioned by name are just a rough outline of those who serve as abbots and high position holders at great monasteries. The term "and others" includes those maintaining teaching and study traditions in various monastic colleges of the great monasteries, those independently maintaining teaching and study traditions while gathering bright students in various regions, and those guiding fortunate beings through bestowing empowerments, explaining tantras, and giving oral instructions while maintaining the concentration of the two stages at various monasteries and hermitages - these are beyond count. Their excellent activities in the Land of Snows are not mere speculation about hidden matters, but are clearly evident through direct observation.

Just as when the lord of the twelfth constellation travels to other realms, the lord of the stars and the host of constellations spread across the divine path, dispelling the darkness of night with their light, likewise your disciples and grand-disciples, hosts of scholars, have spread throughout this Land of Snows, dispelling the darkness of disciples' minds by radiating the white light of the teachings of sutra and tantra.

When searching for equals in this era,
If there were spiritual friends who could compare to this master,
One would need to enumerate many categories
Of such Dharma holders who were produced like this holder of teachings.

The glorious guru who sees all phenomena without exception,
Shows to others through compassion exactly as he sees.
The second Buddha, the Dharma Lord who knows all,
This precious garland of the noble one's life story,

Having composed this with stainless devotion,
By the white karma accumulated thereby, may all beings
Swiftly accomplish the profound path,
The single path traversed by all omniscient victors, and attain enlightenment.

From now on, throughout all lifetimes,
May we be completely cared for by the protector of excellent scholarship and ethics,
And especially at the feet of the omniscient guru,
May we always be nourished by the nectar of his speech.

Having reached the peak of the thirteenth level
Of the vajra holders' ground endowed with eight powers,
May the glorious qualities' radiant light fully expand
And emit rays of excellent enlightened activity.

This text called "The Wondrous Precious Garland: The Biography of the Lord Guru" was composed by the monk and Dharma teacher from Eastern Kongpo named Wangchuk Drubpa Palzangpo, who has long attended the lotus feet of that very Lord Guru himself, fully drunk the nectar of his speech, and possesses unwavering faith in that Lord. It was written at Thubten Namgyal Monastery on the second day of the waxing moon of the first winter month in the Male Fire Tiger year. The scribe was Konchok Pal. Namo Guruve.

Homage to the incomparable Dharma King
Who, seated upon the precious throne of teaching, debating, and composition
In the excellent mansion of the three trainings of merit and virtue,
Has gained dominion over Śākyamuni's teachings. Homage to the wondrous captain of beings
Who, having well-prepared the ship of the well-spoken Vinaya,
Has reached the far shore of the ocean of Abhidharma
And gained mastery over the wish-fulfilling jewel of sūtra meaning. Homage to the omniscient sun of Dharma
Whose teaching falls appropriately on the mountain of disciples,
Whose debate closes the lotus of wrong views,
And whose composition opens the lotus of Buddha's words. Homage to the omniscient lord of yogis
Who purified ordinary concepts through generation stage methods,
Attained the primordial wisdom of great bliss through completion stage dissolution,
And knows without obstruction the words and meaning of all tantras. Homage to the omniscient root of the teachings
Who spreads the teachings by day through explanation, debate and composition,
Meditates single-pointedly by night on profound yoga,
And never wavers from the three purities. Homage to the omniscient Sönam Senge
Who received blessings from qualified gurus,
Whose doubts were cut by special deities,
And who respectfully received commands from the ocean of Dharma protectors. Homage to the glorious vajra holder's feet,
The essence of the three refuges,
Possessing wisdom free from attachment throughout the three times,
The sole refuge for beings of the three realms. Making offerings with an ocean of enchanting offering clouds,
Individually confessing all mental faults,
Rejoicing with deep joy in virtue,
Requesting the turning of the wish-fulfilling Dharma wheel and to remain forever. By the merit of expressing with clear mind
Just a fraction of the glorious guru's qualities,
May all beings abandon all decline of existence and peace
And swiftly attain unsurpassed perfect enlightenment.

May I maintain the nature of the holy beings
Who possess all qualities of higher realms in every circumstance,
Are upheld by the virtuous protectors of extensive learning,
And never tire of bearing the burden of the doctrine and beings.

May I always dwell as an object worthy of viewing,
With melodious speech flowing like unceasing nectar for the ears,
And having pleased all through service and practice,
May I enter into supreme wisdom vision.

By this merit, may the stainless doctrine
Of Śākyasiṃha spread in the ten directions,
And may all the wishes in the mind
Of the glorious guru, lord of Dharma, be fulfilled.

This was composed by me, a follower of the teacher Kong-ston,
Who, though foolish, through the kindness of the genuine guru,
Has the fortune to meditate on the profound path,
And possesses faith to view this tradition thus.

Oṃ svasti rastu!

I pay homage at the feet of the glorious guru
Who sees all phenomena just as they are through knowledge,
Who loves beings with compassion like an only child,
Whose enlightened activity is spontaneous and unceasing.

This excellent printed edition of the precious garland
Of the guru's wondrous biography was made
To help the faithful easily accomplish their aims
And increase the faith of the fortunate ones in all directions.

The scribe who vocalizes unread letters
Is Lha-sung Dorje,
And the engraver who makes relief-like carvings
Is Özer Namgyal, holder of the Tripiṭaka.

The patron who provided all necessary resources
Is the faithful attendant Chökyong Zangpo.
The one who corrected the grammar of words and meaning
According to the guru's instructions is Könchok Pal.

May this virtue, pure as the autumn moon,
By which the scribes, engravers and others have accomplished their work,
Lead all beings in all their lifetimes
To be guided by holy gurus with devotion. Having conquered the masses of darkness of ignorance,
May they swiftly attain the state of the omniscient victor. Furthermore, until saṃsāra is emptied,
May enlightened activity manifest effortlessly and spontaneously. The Biography of the Venerable Lord of Scholars Sönam Senge
Entitled "The Sun's Rays"
By Bhikṣu Sönam Lhundrub

I respectfully prostrate and take refuge at the immaculate lotus feet of the venerable and holy Sakya gurus. I bow at the feet of Mañjuvajra guru,
Who roars like a lion in the center of the earth
With marks and signs of pure white merit,
Illuminating the three realms with the light of excellent speech. This wondrous spectacle that falls upon the minds of the fortunate,
Beautifully adorned with ornaments of the amazing aspects of his deeds,
Making the hairs of faith stand on end—
You who live by the essence of instructions, partake of this!

Regarding the biography of the holy guru, there are two parts:
1. The causes of his deeds
2. The actual manner of his deeds

First, regarding the one who attained the spontaneously accomplished three kāyas of inseparable method and wisdom, as stated in the praise called "The Vajra Holder's Melody" from the Sarvabuddhasamāyoga Tantra:

"Ever stainless, arising from the force of compassion,
Possessing the nature of dharmatā of unobstructed fulfilled aspirations,
Boundlessly diligent in accomplishing beings' welfare,
The essence of great compassion eternally manifests. ".

May this virtue, pure as the autumn moon,
By which the scribes, engravers and others have accomplished their work,
Lead all beings in all their lifetimes
To be guided by holy gurus with devotion.

2. Regarding the actual manner, there are two parts:
2.1. Initial brief summary through verses
2.2. Detailed explanation in prose

2.1. First:
Understanding the nature of conditioned phenomena and the meaning of Dharma,
Attaining signs from desired deities and receiving prophecies of enlightened activity,
Receiving the blessings of holy ones and being cared for by Guru Mañjuśrī,
At the time of empowerment, being entrusted with the doctrine and receiving siddhis from ḍākinīs.

The guru removed obstacles and granted benefit to the teachings,
Averting inner obstacles and receiving signs of benefiting others,
Seeing auspicious dreams and receiving guidance from guides,
These thirteen wondrous unmistaken signs of birth.

Directly seeing Dharma protectors and receiving offerings from gods and humans,
Proclaiming the holy Dharma ghaṇṭā and receiving continuous empowerments from the venerable ones,
Effortlessly training in the grounds and paths for beings' benefit—
These are the four signs of the supreme lord of siddhas.

Explaining sūtra and tantra while averting wrong views,
Being watched over by the compassionate guru while producing holders of the doctrine for beings' benefit,
Making aspirations for others' benefit and arranging future connections—
These are the six exceptional deeds.

Thus there are thirteen signs, four marks of accomplishment, and six exceptional qualities—these twenty-three extraordinary liberating deeds are the basis of what is to be explained.

2.2. Second begins with "Regarding conditioned phenomena..." 

When this guru was six years old, he studied and memorized the text of Bhadracaryā. At that time...

When he merely saw the words "When the inner self comes to the time of death," he understood the nature of impermanence of conditioned phenomena. A genuine bodhicitta arose in his mind - it is the natural way that all holy beings generate bodhicitta from the very beginning of taking birth.

Regarding understanding the meaning of Dharma: at that time, the meanings of the scriptures became clear like reflections appearing in a mirror. Having heard this, his potential for the perfection of wisdom among the six perfections was fully awakened.

Regarding "attaining signs from desired deities": At age eight, he went to where two teachers resided - Rongton Thams cad mkhyen pa's direct disciple Kunga Bum and Master Sönam Özer. There he took the upāsaka vows. His first name was Minyak Pal, but he was given the name Sönam Senge. He thoroughly mastered about fourteen major texts including Madhyamaka Mūla and Avatāra, the Five Dharmas of Maitreya, the Two Types of Vows, Pramāṇavārttika, and up through the Three Knowledges of Yak-tik Rinchen Trengwa and the Rong-tik. He also studied and examined many other dharma topics. At one point while doing the sādhana of Mañjuśrī, he dreamed that he received a sword with a sheath. When he drew it from the sheath, a sign appeared where the light filled an entire valley. This was an authentic sign of being accepted by the desired deity.

Having genuine signs of being accepted by the desired deity is like this. This type of definitive sign is explained in many tantras including the Mañjuśrī Root Tantra.

Regarding "receiving prophecy of enlightened activity": When the great scholar Gobo Rabjampa Sherab Palwa examined the signs, he prophesied, "You will have extensive enlightened activity at a monastery facing south or east from your mountain backdrop." This prophecy manifested exactly as foretold.

Regarding "abiding through the blessings of holy beings": When he was sent with offerings to Rongton Chenpo from his two teachers, as he received the authorization of White Acala from Rongton, at the moment of saying "Please bestow this to the Bhagavan" and "Please begin this," Rongton said "It has dissolved into this one." This was his extraordinary domain of experience.

Regarding the meaning of "being cared for by Mañjughoṣa as guru": This holy one requested from Densa Pa Sherab Palden of Sangphu Ling Med, who had a lineage transmission from the previous masters of guru yoga and recitation practice of Cakrasaṃvara and Arapacana based on Sakya Paṇḍita's generation stage meditation. While practicing this, he once went to Dzongkar. When the path along the cliff was broken at a very narrow gorge in Rongchung valley, he fell into the great whirlpool of the river. Immediately he called out to Sakya Paṇḍita, and while in the water he recited the Cakrasaṃvara practice twenty-four times. Then, when many people were walking on the path, he threw his hat up. When the people noticed this, they lowered a rope and pulled him out.

When it was said thus, it is certain that these are genuine signs of being continuously nourished by Mañjuśrī's inseparable dharma. Through this example, whoever takes refuge while reciting the names of the gurus and lineage holders will also obtain such a treasury of blessings - this should be understood.

Regarding "entrusting the teachings at the time of empowerment": When he reached twenty-five years of age, he went before Dorje Chang Kunga Zangpo at glorious Ewam Chöden. He received the new dharma commentary empowerment. Later, when he received empowerment in the Vajradhātu maṇḍala of Sambhūti, when given the conch shell as the final empowerment substance and told to blow it, he blew it three times, producing an extremely loud sound. This established the auspicious connection of his being enthroned as holder of the dharma by blowing the dharma conch in the future. Then he received many empowerments including the Hevajra empowerment in the Ngo tradition and the authorization of Kāmarāja.

Regarding "receiving siddhis from the ḍākinīs": At that time, the night after receiving the Kurukullā authorization, in a dream a woman wearing red silk gave him a handful of fresh fruit saying "Eat this" and handed him a red drum saying "Beat this." When the guru beat that drum, it was said that the sound pervaded the three thousand worlds. This certainly indicates the blessings bestowed by the ḍākinīs upon those holy beings who are proper vessels.

Then, when he reached twenty-seven years of age, he received fully ordained monk's vows from the great Vajradhara master as preceptor, from the great Gyalmu-pa as karma master, and from Khenchen Bodhisattva Khacharwa as secret preceptor. He cherished the pure monastic vows and aggregate of higher ethics like the pupil of his eye. He conducted himself in a manner like that described in the saying: "After receiving full ordination, one should behave like a monk who has been ordained for a hundred years."

After that, he alternately resided at Mukyi Lingkha Dewachen and Ewam. From the venerable great Mu-pa, he received the precious teaching of Lamdre with its results five times completely, along with the auxiliary Path Cycle teachings and their extensions. He thoroughly mastered the extremely profound Yogini Tantra cycle without leaving anything out. He also received countless other dharma teachings through his kindness.

Around that same time, he received teachings from other holy masters: From Khenchen Bodhisattva, he received the Twelve Purification Mandalas, the empowerment of Condensed Lineages [Gurikndu], and the authorization of Black Hayagriva and others. From Gungru Sherab Zangpo, Dagchen Zhalu-pa, and Dagchen Chumig-pa, he received the Distinction of the Three Vows, the authorization of Chaturmukha, the authorization of Sole Mahākāla in the Drogmi tradition, and others. He received an extremely vast range of empowerments, transmissions, instructions, and detailed practical guidance, mastering them completely.

Regarding "dispelling obstacles by the guru": While residing at Lingkhar, when he was receiving one "red" teaching commentary, he suddenly became severely ill for one full day. That evening, he rested with his head facing toward Muchen's residence. In a dream-like state, the residence became filled with fragrant scents, and Muchen appeared, offering him many sips of blessed water. At that moment, the sudden heart illness vanished like clouds dispersing in the sky. Such experiences are supreme signs of progress on the path. This accords with what Sakya Paṇḍita said in his letter of advice: "When giving up life's composite factors, through diligently accomplishing your supreme teachings, Lord, obstacles in between are liberated," just as explained in the profound path of guru yoga.

Regarding "benefiting the teachings": At age thirty-one, when the two brothers were preparing to travel to Dokham, they first stopped at Ewam. At that time, Jamchen Rabjampa, the lord of the doctrine, presented a petition letter regarding patronage to Rinpung Norbu Zangpo, along with the message of Rongton Chenpo's prophecy and other matters.

Regarding this, [the teacher] said "You should stay in Ü-Tsang to teach and study, and must not go to Kham. However, you may go to Dzongkar." The master Rabjampa also said "I cannot imagine sending you to Kham - it would be too much." Then they went to Dzongkar. When they presented a petition to go to Kham to Lord Dzongkar-wa, since the guru had not made a definitive decision based on the monastery's intent, they sent Dragngapa to ask the elder brother Yeshe Gyaltsen and Muchen to examine it. At that time, Muchen said: "No need to examine - if you go to Kham, there will be no long life and little benefit to the teachings, though there will be great wealth. If you stay in Ü-Tsang, though there will be little wealth, there will be great benefit to the teachings and a somewhat longer life." Then, in accordance with Muchen's intention, the two brothers [decided that] Lama Yeshe Gyaltsen would go to Kham, while this great being would stay in Ü-Tsang and focus his mind on carrying out vast activities for the teachings.

Similarly, at the time of establishing teaching and study, on the evening before Chöje Kutrülwa and this Chöje were both supposed to meet with Muchen for discussions, Kutrülwa had a dream where someone was building a great Dharma throne. When asked who made it, it was said to be "Jetsün Drakpa's Dharma throne." The next day when the three - teacher and disciples - met, Kutrülwa reported this dream. At this, Muchen's face showed great pleasure as he said "This is an extremely auspicious connection." He then made the decision to establish teaching and study. In the Dog year's spring, when Kutrülwa came to invite him and he went to teach, the great victor Mupa placed his lotus feet on his crown and made aspirations.

The holy guru tested the truth with the root and lineage gurus, dakinis, and dharma protectors, saying "Since this is for the Buddha's teachings in general and particularly for the glorious Sakya teachings, teaching and studying sutra and tantra, protect from obstacles and provide favorable conditions. " He performed countless physical exercises and movements, bestowed hundreds of nectar pills, thousand-stone offerings and many other gifts, and appointed him as the holy Dharma regent who would uphold the Victor's teachings. As it is said in the Praise of the Sage composed by Chöje Sakya Pandita: "Your son is Manjushri, your student is the son of Sarasvati, Maitreya was appointed as the holy regent - who could have any doubt about this?" Similarly, all the meaning of the authorization was manifested without remainder. Regarding "averting outer and inner obstacles": In general, for these holy beings, all appearances are like illusions and inseparable from the naturally unborn state. Therefore, as it is said "Whatever appears as experiential appearances, if recognized, demons and pitfalls are self-liberated," they are naturally liberated from obstructive phenomena. However, there is no contradiction in making a mere outer display to inspire effort in those of lesser capacity and to distinguish outer and inner obstacles. Furthermore, when this great being was staying at Dzongkar in the Snake year, he became very seriously ill. At that time, Ngakchang Rinchen Namgyal was attending him, and in his dream there appeared a king who was creating obstacles for this guru.

When asked "What is the reason you are creating obstacles for him?" and "Where did you come from?", he replied, "I am the king of Guge. We Guge people have great wealth and resources at Ngor. Since the rightful owner has not come, one of the most powerful upholders of the Ngor tradition will arrive, so I am creating obstacles. "  Because of this, he was advised to perform focused spiritual practice. Ngakchang Rinchen Namgyal, who was generally diligent in pure training of the three vows and possessed great power, with authentic dream visions and pure appearances arising, took this to heart. Initially, for twenty-one days he maintained unbroken practice, and then primarily focused on the meditation sessions of the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana for four sessions. After seven days, at dusk, the magical manifestations of that previously mentioned king appeared. At that time, he performed the visualization of offering his body and rested in meditative equipoise on the view. The frightening appearances dissolved like a rainbow, and from then on, day by day, his health became excellent and his physical strength was regained. He also completed the foundation practice of Hevajra, and during these times there were many extraordinary signs that appeared. By uniting such authentic view with great compassion, he was able to defeat all classes of maras, as was known in ancient India. As it is said in the extensive Lalitavistara Sutra: "The Shakya king, thoroughly understanding dependent origination, phenomena as non-existent and essenceless, possessed a sky-like mind, and remained unmoved upon seeing the hosts of evil ones. ".

Like this, and furthermore, just as he had commanded the special protectors of the venerable Sakyapa, through the power of accomplishing their enlightened activities, he was able to avert outer and inner obstacles. When he had not yet arrived at Sakya, while performing torma practice at Kyela, Dönpo Namkha Nyingpo directly witnessed that the Indian-originated 'Doma Thug' statue bowed its head toward this master. And while staying at Thubten, once in a dream two Mon children were at what seemed to be the cave of Kyela. When he said to them, "These monk-like attendants appear to be emanations of Mahakala in brahmin form," those two Mon children bowed their heads and smiled. Then he asked, "Since you are Mahakala, you have unobstructed clairvoyance. Would you be pleased if I focus single-pointedly on practice at the end of my life, or if I teach?" They spoke only the word "practice," then rolled their heads and smiled in the dream, he said. Such displays were manifestations of the pleasure of the Jñāna-protectors.

During certain times when he showed signs of illness, by performing torma practice and meditation for about seven days, he was clearly liberated from obstacles without difficulty. When he was composing the great general treatise on the Sutras, Saptadarśana, and Pramāṇa called "The Sun Mirror Sound" [nyi ma me long rnga sgra], in a dream two monks named Gelong Lörinpa were singing praises with melody. Then from the upper valley came many sounds of music and rays of light, along with many military forces. When asked what this was, they said it was the armies of the Four-Faced Mahākāla. From the knees down, they were about three stories tall, their retinue gleamed with armor, and their boot decorations jingled. They said, "We will be the guardians of your praises. " After that, he completed the entire body of the treatise. This coincided with Je Namkha Sönam's dream, who said: "That monastery will definitely be established without rivals. In my dream, at the base of Black Horse Mountain, there was a great encampment. When I asked what encampment it was, someone said it was the encampment of Sakya's Gur Mgon. It is excellent that a Sakya teaching will come to Black Horse. " These renowned true words were heard. Thus, even in the perception of others, it was manifestly established that no inner obstacles could overwhelm him. Regarding this, it is said:
"Even the deceptions of evil minds acting in darkness,
Before wisdom like the sun so clear,
Like the mechanisms of a lifeless chariot,
Are exhausted by the burden of meaningless effort. The Nāga lord wearing a crown jewel,
Protected by the beautiful mantras of fame's feet,
That twice-born one wearing protective armor—
Who else is worthy to compete with such a lord?"
Thus it was proclaimed.

Here's the proper translation up to the last complete sentence:

Regarding the signs of benefiting others and inner qualities: 

Once in a dream, there were many golden written 'ti' [syllables]. When looking at all of them, there was only the phrase "Homage to Bhagavati Mahishavardhini." He said this seemed to relate to his composition of the Bhairava mandala and abhisheka according to the Earth tradition, and its great flourishing. Moreover, this was a genuine sign of being blessed by the yidam deity. This accords perfectly with what is explained in the Samanya-tantra: "Seeing buddhas in dreams is like receiving vast qualities directly, as well as stupas, holy dharma, making offerings to them, and reciting sutras."

Furthermore, from the Sheep year to the Monkey year while at Dzongkar, he gave extensive teachings on the Sutra tradition and composed works on the general meaning of the three vows and commentaries. During that time, on the night of a lunar eclipse, in a dream a white person placed a very large white conch shell in his lap that filled his entire cross-legged posture. Regarding this, he said "It seems this indicates that a certain Trinle Gama will come." This was a special authentic sign, as explained in many sutras and tantras like before.

Regarding "being guided after seeing auspicious dreams": When this guru was composing a treatise on the Sarvavidya [Kunrig], one night in his dream, many monks were building a great Dharma throne in a vast meadow. When asked whose throne it was, they said it was the throne for teaching the Practice Lineage by the great master Muchen.

Regarding that dream, this guru himself participated in building the throne. Then Muchen ascended the throne and, surrounded by many attendants, began teaching the Practice Lineage. Wondering if his composition would be beneficial, he listened carefully and retained in mind exactly one folio's worth of beneficial words for the composition, which he later wrote in the "Refutation of Disputes on Sarvavidya." At its conclusion, he also wrote "saw signs of marks on a mountain peak in a dream."

Thus, up to this point, these life stories are established through valid cognition of self-awareness exactly as his qualities existed, and when others see and hear them, they become causes for generating faith in wise beings whose minds are undisturbed by partisan bias. These were the thirteen auspicious signs.

Now regarding the first of the four signs of accomplishment, namely "directly seeing dharma protectors":

One night at Tanag Serling, when a Geshe named Tenpa Rabsel, who was a Kachu scholar from Samdrub Tse monastery and maintained pure discipline, came to make a request, it had grown dark. [The master] scolded him saying, "Other than a Nepali, there previously came here an ascetic [atsa ra] with a conch shell in his ear who seemed about to say something, but now he has gone."

Regarding other instances, although there was no one present beside him, there seemed to be one or two or three people speaking in an indescribable voice, as if there was a companion. This was also sensed by several regular attendants like A'u Zhönnu Zangpo.

Regarding "receiving offerings from gods and humans": When the master and disciples of Bodong were traveling to teach dharma, at Jagöshong when they went to see the self-arisen Avalokiteshvara, there was an exceptionally large shower of flowers which everyone considered miraculous. This was like when in ancient times, as explained, when the Bhagavan taught profound sutras like the Prajnaparamita, the gods made offerings with mandārava flowers, great mandārava flowers, and others. Similarly in this northern region, when many holy beings such as the Dharma Lord Sakya Pandita, the lord of scholars Yagdruk Sangye Pal, and our guide Lord Kunga Wangchuk taught authentic dharma, great showers of flowers fell, which was undoubtedly offerings made by gods who rejoiced in the precious teachings.

Just as the gods made offerings, similarly, in order to benefit all beings through the two types of precious bodhicitta and special inner qualities, countless spiritual friends equal to himself, the great lords of the earth who protect the dharma and rule the four directions, countless disciples of clear intelligence and sincere aspiration, and even ordinary beings with just slight roots of virtue in accordance with merit, all established dharma connections with this holy being, not to mention seeing his form and qualities.

Merely seeing his form and hearing some of his qualities and teachings, or even just remembering his name, greatly increased collections of mental clarity and generated wonder, bringing satisfaction to the mind. Through various means such as causing goosebumps to arise, all became devoted followers making offerings to him - except for those unfortunate beings who, under the influence of negative companions and afflicted by the demon of wrong views, had their intellectual power diminished and, lacking guides to see the authentic meaning, grasped at mirages like water-skaters.

Regarding "Proclaiming the Holy Dharma Gandi," in the Year of the Ox during summer, representatives from Ewam Chöden monastery came to Thubten with their monastic rules and presented reasons why this master should take up responsibility for the Ewam monastery seat. Previously in a dream, he had seen many monks carrying loads on their backs going toward Lachung. When this master struck the gandi at the upper floor of Ngor, those monks returned and there was a vision of teaching them dharma. Remembering both this and the auspicious connections made when Lord Vajradhara bestowed the Sambhuti empowerment, and recalling how when Lord Vajradhara Kunga Wangchuk was traveling to Ngari, his final words included instructions to maintain the philosophical views of the previous masters and to extend one's efforts regarding monasteries both near and far - considering all this and thinking the time was right, he accepted. He arrived at Ewam for the golden offering ceremony in the Year of the Ox and gave some dharma teachings.

Then, arriving for the first winter teachings at Thubten Namgyal, the three assistant teachers and dharma heir deputy Tsultrim Zang took charge of teaching dharma to the assembly. They properly established whatever rules and systems were needed for the assembly. Again in the Year of the Tiger, arriving at Ewam, without taking the throne, he taught various aspects of dharma such as the Path and View. Then, when the extremely auspicious time and date of the first month of the Year of the Hare arrived on the fifth day of the waxing moon, he was requested to take the dharma throne of the great Vajradhara himself, lord of the six realms. Many auspicious verses from gods and humans were recited, many showers of flower petals fell, and he was empowered as the great regent. At that time, the great dharma patrons from all directions, spiritual friends with their retinues from various dharma colleges, and the ocean-like assembly of sangha members from Ewam's various departments offered auspicious celebrations. The ocean-like assembly of fortunate disciples, equal in number to particles of dust, placed him like a precious crown jewel upon their heads. From that day onwards for four years, he bestowed many empowerments connected with the individual tantras, along with their individual auxiliary practices of the pure uncontaminated generation stage, completion stage, and oral instructions, as well as blessings from the individual tantras.

The nine profound stages of guidance, and especially the nectar of speech from the great master of yoga Virupa that was well-received through the devoted listening of the venerable Sakyapas and their lineage holders - the precious teaching of the Path with its Result including all its auxiliary branches - along with their scriptural supports: the root tantra Hevajra in Two Sections, the uncommon explanatory tantra Vajrapanjara, and the common explanatory tantra Samputa, these three tantras. He excellently explained these profound and vast teachings in a complete manner, thus constantly establishing disciples on the authentic path. While he was continuously exerting himself day and night in this way, certain signs appeared. Regarding one called "The Continuous Empowerment of the Venerable One": During the dawn after performing the causal empowerment, in a dream someone said "You are creating vast beneficial connections for others" and poured what was said to be the vase water of Venerable Grags pa onto his body, which transformed into a vision of Amitayus's dhāraṇī. Additionally, in the dream of Khenpo Kunlo, when this great being was sitting on the throne at Ewam, Venerable Grags pa Gyaltsen appeared in the space above. Thinking "This is a method for benefiting others for a long time," he transformed into the form of the great Venerable Amitayus - this vision appeared in accordance with the previous one.

These unique four aspects are extraordinary signs indicating the ability to guide disciples whose mindstreams are completely ripened without further effort. Moreover, since these largely pertain to the domain of those dwelling on the noble levels [ārya-bhūmi], it is said: "These four signs of the supreme lord of siddhas are: complete abandonment and realization of grounds and paths, and effortless benefit of beings."

Now, regarding the first of the six exceptional deeds, namely "giving explanations of sūtra and tantra": In general, great accomplished scholars primarily work for the doctrine through the three activities of explaining, debating, and composing. With this in mind, this great being also extensively propagated the teachings of the Sugata through the three approaches of explanation, debate, and composition. Regarding how he composed: In general, holy beings who abide on the noble path can explain the Buddha's intent independently without relying on other commentaries, and although this master similarly had independent authority over the meaning of the scriptures,

In order to inspire faith in the Buddha's words among disciples of this degenerate age, he composed treatises that explicate the intent of both sūtra and tantra texts. These included many works in commonly known areas of the pāramitā tradition, the uncommon vajrayāna tradition, and various genres addressing topics common to both sūtra and tantra such as question-answer texts and collections of praises. Since the titles are clear in the catalog, they are not written here. Regarding the nature of the treatises themselves, whatever he composed was characterized by elegant language and vast meaning. He thoroughly explained difficult points without unnecessary verbosity. Through careful analysis and examination, he discovered definitive understanding of the subject matter that knows no bounds. As stated in the praise composed by Venerable Sönam Tsemo: "Having thoroughly analyzed the intended meaning with discriminating wisdom, with reddened eyes that see to the ultimate limit of time and particles. "

The vastness of the subject matter is illustrated in the Domsum Trulpong: "I bow at the lotus feet of Mañjughoṣa Guru, who is the indivisible essence of the three tantras made manifest - the glorious, natural, indestructible state of bliss, the inner nature of HŪṂ itself; the supreme method of bliss, protected by the three vajras that ripen through empowerment; and the unchanging bliss whose PHAṬ liberates the essence from the sheath of conceptual marks. "

This single verse excellently explains: the qualities of the treatise's author as a buddha; the complete essential subject matter of the treatise he composed along with its benefits; and the reasons why those with wrong views need to be refuted and defeated. As for "refuting wrong views and mistaken thoughts," this refers to how he illuminated the Buddha's teachings through debate.

In this Land of Snows, although many spoke wrongly about the Buddha's teaching, the glorious great Sakya Paṇḍita came and largely cleared away the stains on the doctrine, as is clear in the "Differentiation of the Three Vows." Even after that, various other holy beings who came later also provided some clarification.

Later, the lord of the six families, the great Vajradhara known as Kunga Zangpo, who remembered his previous lives as about twelve paṇḍitas of India, spread the entirety of the Buddha's teachings in general and particularly the unmistaken view and tenets of the earlier Sakya masters. Following his illumination of the Buddha's words like the rising sun, certain spiritual friends who had weak training in the secret mantrayāna due to habitual tendencies of negative thoughts from beginningless saṃsāra and insufficient training in this life, incorrectly explained the methods for training in the profound essential points. This great being refuted them through numerous scriptural citations and reasoning. He composed many works like the "Distinguishing Tenets" that clearly presented the philosophical systems of the earlier masters along with reasoning.

Furthermore, when some took on the burden of composing a text called "Ocean of Thatness," claiming it was prophesied by the yidam deities, and attacked the writings of the Venerable Precious Dragpa, this great intelligence thoroughly refuted them.

He composed treatises that thoroughly explained the systematic presentation of scripture and reasoning. Furthermore, when some made various arguments challenging the meaning of the Namshé Dazer through analytical investigation, he defeated them through scripture and reasoning and composed treatises that corrected the interpretation according to the intent of the Supreme Guide. Later, when some individuals developed deep animosity toward all the writings of the glorious Sakya Paṇḍita, particularly the text known as "Differentiation of the Three Vows," interpreting the ultimate view of sūtra and tantra as Mind-Only and largely misinterpreting the meaning of the Three Vows, this lord of speech thoroughly refuted each of their positions and composed works that clearly revealed the true meaning, such as "Eliminating Confusion Regarding the Three Vows," "Supplement to the Three Vows," and "Illuminating the Excellent Path: A Commentary on the Meaning of the Excellent Method's Sunlight" which specifically refutes confusion regarding essential points of the view. In this text, when refuting these temporarily mistaken views regarding the view, he extensively refutes nine inappropriate consequences:
1. All beings would be liberated without effort
2. The presentation of the four philosophical systems would be inappropriate
3. The Cittamātra philosophical system and its proponents would be inappropriate
4. The ultimate view could not be identified
5. The meaning of Madhyamaka would be inappropriate
6. The functions of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa would be inappropriate
7. The method of eliminating attachment would become the Chinese view
8. The subsequent word applications would be inappropriate
9. The compatibility between earlier and later [statements] would be inappropriate.

Thus through methods of debate that establish proofs and refute [positions], he was undoubtedly able to overwhelm all challengers, both self and other. Regarding "benefiting beings and producing upholders of the doctrine": Like the sunlight of explanation, he vastly spread the Buddha's teachings. Starting from when he first began teaching and studying in various regions until he later gave explanations of both sūtra and tantra everywhere, he produced countless beings who upheld the doctrine. In particular, having abided in the three inner qualities, he produced many supreme principal spiritual sons capable of guiding limitless disciples. These included the glorious fourth Sakya throne holder Sönam Gyaltsen Pelzangpo, the holy regent of the Victorious Vajradhara - the venerable Dharma Lord Könchok Pelwa, and the holy regent of the Great Victorious Muspa - the venerable Dharma Lord Sangye Rinchen, and other regents of the previous masters. Among his contemporaries, there was no one who had not become his student among the numerous masters of scripture and reasoning. Their names are too many to write here.

In particular, on the twenty-fifth day of the fourth Mongol month in the Horse year, during the great festival, he formally enthroned the holy regent Könchok Pelwa on the great Dharma throne. Regarding this holy regent, the great Victorious Vajradhara had prophesied that he would be of future benefit, and the Great Victorious Muspa also [made a prophecy] to the Venerable Holy Kunga Wangchuk.

In particular, on the twenty-fifth day of the fourth Mongol month in the Horse year, during the great festival, he formally enthroned the holy regent Könchok Pelwa on the great Dharma throne. Regarding this holy regent, the Great Victorious Vajradhara had prophesied that he would be of future benefit, and the Great Victorious Muspa also gave instructions to the Venerable Holy Kunga Wangchuk, saying "Let Dharma Lord Könchok Pelwa engage diligently in studies." Keeping these matters in mind, he properly entrusted him with the doctrine of the Venerable Great Vajradhara along with the assembly of disciples and dharma protectors, and prophesied him to be a master of the dharma.

Regarding "the kind master's visions": In the Wood-Dragon year, when he needed to give empowerments [smin byed] of the Speech [gsung ngag] to about a thousand assembled disciples, he became slightly ill due to the power of the cold winter months. While resting briefly during the day, in a dream vision, the Venerable Great Sakyapa appeared and said "Do not be negligent in benefiting beings." At that time, he also performed the refuge prayer:

"Vajradhara, lord of all six realms,
Mañjuśrī, the wisdom of all victorious ones,
Virūpa, the power of all buddhas—
In you, the inseparable guru, I take refuge."

This is what I heard from some biographies. Thus, this master, through the power of his special inner meditative realization, had many pure visions externally—directly, in meditation experiences, and through signs—seeing many buddhas and bodhisattvas and traveling to many buddha realms.

Regarding "making aspirations to benefit others": Although he always made pure aspirations focused on benefiting the doctrine and beings at all times and occasions...

Although he was always diligent, in particular, considering that the power of aspirations made in special sacred places of the previous guru-like buddhas would have greater effect, in the Monkey year on the eighth day of the eleventh Mongol month, invited by both the Great Temple and the Lhasa officials, about seven hundred teachers and students from the great seat of Glorious Sakya arrived. During Sakya Paṇḍita's great festival, for over two thousand resident and visiting monastics of this great place, he provided excellent communal tea twice, and made extensive arrangements including distributions of 114 zho of gold. Furthermore, from the available resources, he arranged extensive butter lamp offerings for each temple and made inconceivable special offerings. After establishing regular practices such as repairs for temples and commemorative offerings for the previous masters, he made countless pure aspirations focusing on the precious doctrine and limitless sentient beings. During those occasions too, he satisfied beings through limitless means including teaching the holy Dharma of sutras and tantras, giving empowerments, authorizations, transmissions, and instructions. All the people residing there firmly believed that this holy master was truly an emanation of the Venerable Precious Grags pa Gyaltsen. At that time too, it is said that the Venerable Great Sakyapa appeared in a dream.

The Dharma protectors too are not satisfied merely by counting mantras, but require melodies, feast offerings, and torma practice rituals. It is said that they particularly enjoy these. Thus, dedicating without exception even the slightest roots of virtue toward benefiting others, his conduct matched that of the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra - this is indeed the authentic biography of a noble one dwelling on the grounds.

Then, considering the vast benefit for other disciples to be tamed, he displayed infinite pure visions before demonstrating the manner of passing into peace. Although there were many aspects of both common and uncommon types of liberation during those occasions, they are not written here. Those who are interested should seek these from the truthful words of those who served at his feet for a long time.

Now regarding the sixth topic called "Arranging Future Auspicious Connections": While residing at that great seat, at all times he performed seven, five, or at minimum three regular feast offerings with renewal rituals before the emanated Beg mgon, without fail. He made aspirations focused on the doctrine in general and beings in particular. Specifically, he made aspirations that there would be no obstacles to establishing golden statues representing the Teacher in the Buddhist doctrine, and that merely by beings seeing, hearing about, or bringing to mind [these statues], benefit would arise for sentient beings.

He made aspirations that through merely seeing, hearing, or bringing to mind [these statues], benefit would arise for sentient beings. In particular, considering the auspicious connections for the future flourishing of the Venerable Sakyapa's doctrine, he offered prayers before that very Beg mgon with ritual torma and seal-impressed offerings.

Thus, thinking only of the Buddha's doctrine throughout the three times, he benefited disciples through the three activities of teaching, debating, and composing, and through hearing, contemplation, and meditation. This is not the domain of those of lesser vehicles like śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. Because it surpasses those, there are six aspects that are superior to others.

Having said this, these twenty-three aspects of his liberation story have been explained in detail. The order of these twenty-three is not arranged chronologically, but rather according to categories such as the marvelous, the accomplished, and the exceptional. Moreover, some additional liberation stories and uncommon modes of conduct contained herein should be carefully investigated by understanding their implicit meaning.

Like the sun bringing joy to the unwavering faithful lotus of the heart,
And like a clear mirror for the wise whose minds are unstained by partisan dust,
Though the qualities of the holy ones are unfathomably deep,
Following the flawless teachings of the Sage,
With a pure mind free from the three stains,
I have clearly arranged the true meaning as it is.

Those lacking learning but full of pride,
Who criticize hundreds of well-spoken teachings,
And with mere peaceful conduct like a water skimmer...

Having little learning but full of manifest pride,
Criticizing hundreds of well-spoken teachings,
And with mere peaceful conduct like a water skimmer,
What liberation story is there in dwelling alone?

Through austerities that merely torment body and mind,
They claim this alone is the cause for attaining unequaled liberation. Who would praise the ways of those mendicants
Who accumulate only hundreds of faults?

Claiming to match the conduct of young bodhisattvas,
Like madmen disregarding cause and effect,
Strutting about bearing matted hair—
What supreme nature have they attained?

Taking mantras' power and recitation as primary,
With feast offerings pleasing worldly spirits,
Claiming unobstructed accomplishment of the four activities—
Who would praise those who destroy self and others?

Following mere meaningless words like empty husks,
They proclaim confusion,
And like monkeys performing mimicry—
Such speakers have no essence whatsoever. Born from the fire crystal of the expanded three trainings,
Radiating a thousand lights illuminating objects of knowledge just as they are,
Opening the lotus garland of disciples to be trained—
I too have faith in that holy sun. From the crystalline sphere of the two minds,
All aspects of loving-kindness completely illuminate,
Shining bright among the many star-like scholars—
The peerless lord of night is worthy of homage. The wish-fulfilling tree of the two stages with branches of profound meaning,
Heavy with the fruit of union,
Waving cool shade of enlightened activity—
Who would not rely on this as the supreme place of accomplishment?

Seeing all these qualities without exception,
If anyone thinks otherwise with wrong view,
It is merely like dwelling in darkness
And resenting the light of the sun.

Therefore, while not just coveting your words alone,
By seeing the biographies of those with qualities and others
Like supreme jewels versus common stones,
I have composed this amazing account of your deeds.

May the supreme stainless virtue arising from this,
Like towering masses of perfectly white snow mountains,
And like the rising clear rays of moonlight,
Remove the torment of beings' ignorance.

This brief account of the liberation story of the Lord of Dharma, the glorious and holy guru, the great scholar known as Sönam Sengé whose dharma eye illuminates the entire sphere of knowledge, was composed by the monk Sönam Lhundrup Lekpé Jungné Gyaltsen Pelzangpo on the fifteenth day of the second month of the Dragon year at the glorious E-wam Chöden, the source of precious qualities, at the repeated request of many faithful disciples who urged both immediately and over time, saying "Please compose a biography of this great being," due to having uncommon devotion to this great being.

May virtue increase!

OṂ SVASTI SIDDHÁM

I bow down with respect with my supreme limbs and take refuge at the stainless lotus feet of that kind, holy root guru, the supreme guide, the Dharma King.

I bow down again with faithful devotion to you, the protector whose enlightened qualities and activities are as vast as a wish-fulfilling tree. Please grasp me with the great iron hook of your compassion, Konchog Lhundrup, throughout all births and lives. Your glorious wisdom's radiant majesty dispels the poverty of beings in the three realms and serves as the foundation for nurturing the Buddha's teachings. Through your vast ocean of compassion encompassing limitless disciples like the earth holding jewels, you bestow whatever scriptural and realized teachings are desired. Your vast enlightened activities, like Indra granting wishes, skillfully traverse to the ends of existence, spreading garlands of pure white fame. As such a venerable lord of the wheel, you are the actual Three Jewels, a wish-fulfilling jewel expanding aspirations, crowned above all beings including deities. Your amazing body, majestic like a golden mountain, leads fortunate beings and is the nectar of joy. Your stainless voice, like the melody of Brahma's drum, generates deep and vast delight in the Dharma in the hearts of scholars. Your mind, vast like unchanging space regardless of conditions, is free from conceptual thoughts and clearly sees the three times without obscurations. I bow again with spontaneous faith to you, the protector whose qualities and activities expand like a wish-fulfilling tree. The all-pervading lords of pride - the precious Wheel and Vajra, and the Lotus Sword joined in union with their consorts; likewise the lords of secrets - Ākāśagarbha, Kṣitigarbha, Samantabhadra, Ajita, Mañjuśrī, and Avalokiteśvara who removes obscurations; the glory of stainless bliss adorned with mirror, tambura, finest fragrances, exquisite food and clothing, and lotus holders; the powerful wrathful lords and other victorious ones display in each pore of your body countless buddha-fields.

Having your qualities vast as space
And deep as the great ocean with no visible depths,
Even all the Buddhas can hardly fathom them -
What need to mention one like me trying to describe them for eons?

Yet following the words of the holy ones,
Like drops of water from the great ocean,
I will express just a few commonly apparent aspects -
Listen with joy, O wise ones!

This supreme holy lord, inseparable from Vajradhara, lord of all families and all-pervading master, is the captain of scholars, siddhas and vidyādharas. His lotus feet are paid homage to by hosts of devas, ṛṣis, gandharvas, kiṃnaras and others. As the great Dharma king unrivaled in the three realms of existence, he cherishes solely the precious teachings and, viewing all beings equally, establishes those with fortune on the path of ripening and liberation through many instructions and teachings. As this great guide whose name is difficult to express due to being completely unobscured in all aspects, whose enlightened activities increase all qualities of the Three Jewels - even the lord of Victorious Ones with his heirs would find it difficult to describe all the liberating deeds of his body, speech and mind. How could childish ones like us with inferior intellect and little training possibly do so?

Manifesting in the magnificently arrayed pure realm through the five aspects of complete enlightenment, he displayed the playful manifestation inseparable from Vairocana, the wisdom ocean of pristine awareness, characterized by spontaneously accomplished and unceasing enlightened activities for as long as existence endures. Without moving from the dharmakāya where all elaborations are pacified, he was first established on the throne.

In pure realms, he manifests as the saṃbhogakāya, and in impure realms, he appears as a Buddha to those to be tamed by Buddhas, as a bodhisattva to those to be tamed by bodhisattvas, and likewise as śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bhikṣus, householders, Indra, Brahma, sun and moon, mountains, medicines, trees, elephants and other beings through magical displays of all animate and inanimate phenomena that beings experience.

This is established as a source of faith through many authentic scriptures, flawless reasoning, and extremely profound instructions. Therefore, since the activities of the Buddhas are solely in accordance with the dispositions of those to be tamed, in order to guide disciples of lesser fortune like ourselves in these later times, he emanated as an ordinary spiritual friend. I will briefly relate the liberation story as it appeared to disciples in accordance with their capacity. O those endowed with excellent intelligence and faith, listen! From the mere hearing, it will become meaningful.

Why is this so? As taught in the stainless scriptures of the Sugata:

Having listened to these stainless scriptures of the Sugata: "In the world, among all lineages, the Śākyas have become supreme. By recounting their previous births and fully comprehending them, when extensively explained to others in accordance with the Dharma, immeasurable merit accumulates and inconceivable qualities increase." Thus it is taught that when relating the previous lives of holy beings who appeared from whatever lineage, great merit arises.

What need to mention how the two accumulations will be completely filled by the nectar of hearing even a fraction of the qualities of this supreme guide who accomplishes the activities of all the Victorious Ones for us? Since the lord Vajradhara himself proclaimed that paying homage and serving even a single pore of the Vajra Master yields greater merit than making offerings to all the Victorious Ones of the three times along with their heirs and disciples, and since it is repeatedly taught in all the stainless scriptures and treatises that the wisdom knowing all aspects which is to be deeply contemplated depends on pleasing the lotus face of the Vajra Master.

How is this so? As taught in the Mother of the Victorious Ones: "The Buddha's teachings depend on virtuous spiritual friends - thus spoke the Victor who possesses all supreme qualities." And: "One should always rely on learned masters. Why? Because the qualities of learning arise from them." And from the Fifty Verses: "Having abandoned all other offerings, properly engage in offering to the guru. By pleasing them, the omniscient state..."

Will attain supreme wisdom." And from the Hevajra Tantra: "The co-emergent which cannot be explained by others is not found anywhere. It should be known through relying on the guru's methods and one's own merit." This and more is extensively taught.

Therefore, since the Vajra Master who generates precious qualities in one's mindstream is the very essence of all the Buddhas of the three times, they are the supreme object to be completely pleased through all forms of pleasing activities.

How is this evident? As taught in the glorious Primordial Kālacakra Great Tantra: "The master is the Buddha himself, teaching the Dharma on this excellent earth as foundation." And from the Ultimate Service: "He is the primordial Buddha Vajrasattva himself, he is the Lord Protector of the World and glorious Mañjuśrī, he is the glorious Cittavajra Ḍākinī, he is traversed by the unchanging yoga," and so forth up to "For those who rely on the holy guru, [they are like] a wish-fulfilling jewel."

From the River Vacha Sūtra: "In the final five hundred years, I myself will abide in the form of teachers. Thinking 'This is me,' generate devotion to them at that time." And the Lord of Yoga also said: "Do not view the guru and Vajrasattva as different. The guru is Buddha, Dharma, and likewise Sangha. Those who desire the supreme state of accomplishment should please the guru in every way. The actual embodiment of the Buddha, Vajradhara, in this time of strife, for my benefit..."

For my sake, [the guru] teaches in accordance with all. Having understood this, through all material things, one will become a vessel for the vast accomplishments of the Buddhas of the three times.

Since this and other flawless scriptures and treatises are taught with one intention and one voice, therefore:

1. In order to completely perfect the extraordinary accumulations of merit and wisdom in one's own and others' mindstreams
2. To generate faith in those who lack faith and strengthen the faculty of faith in those who have faith
3. Since it is the unsurpassed offering that pleases the Victor and his heirs
4. To ultimately attain the Buddhas' speech with sixty melodious qualities
5. And since earnest students who delight in some elaboration have also requested it

This explanation is extremely beautiful. The holy guru's pleased face is that which, when relied upon, bestows even the supreme siddhi - the glorious Vajrasattva's sovereignty - easily in this very life.

Though wasted many times since beginningless time, now here, since the exhaustion of sensory attachment bears fruit, this account praised by all the Victors and their heirs is without fault.

As for where our guru took birth through the power of aspirations: In a place one hundred yojanas north of Vajrāsana, the essence of enlightenment, in the snowy land abundant with glorious good qualities, on the surface of the earth holder (mountain) white like the light of the moon, with precious emeralds and

Through garlands of emeralds, indranīla (sapphires), and kekeru adorned everywhere, countless monasteries beautify [the land] completely. It was frequented by many unrivaled scholars and lords of accomplishment, filled with countless assemblies of wealthy people, the ground pervaded by delightful fields of grain and medicinal plants, and adorned with numerous auspicious signs and virtuous omens.

At the great monastic seat known as the glorious Sakya, renowned as having a garland [of qualities] that encircles the ocean-clad earth treasury, in the great palace called Gura Deden Teng: He was born as the son of Pön Ne Tashi Lekpa - who was the son of Pön Ne Sönam Pal (the younger brother of the one known as Lord Kunga Zangpo, whose fame banner illuminated the three realms of existence, who was inseparable from Vajrasattva the lord of all families, a supreme emanated being prophesied in many stainless sūtras, the crown jewel of all holders of the sugarcane lineage) - and Udren, who was born into a family without misconduct and was adorned with many qualities arising from both birth and training. He was born in the Female Wood Ox year called Trowo (Wrathful), accompanied by many wonderful omens. When he was in his mother's womb...

When he was in his mother's womb, his mother's body was light and her complexion healthy. At the time of birth, there was no harm to his mother, and his parents' wealth, prosperity, happiness, and harvests increased, along with many other auspicious signs and omens. He was given the name Arin Palden. Like Vajrāsana where scholars and siddhas gather,
Like Central Öyul where the sound of Dharma resounds,
Like the five-peaked mountain where Mañjuśrī's emanations dwell—
At glorious Sakya, you were born. Like the full moon rising over the eastern mountain peak,
Like a swan bathing in a lotus lake,
Though attaining the birthless dharmakāya, as a nirmāṇakāya
You deliberately took birth in a high and pure family. Along with this, abundant prosperity increased,
Clouds brought rain and crops ripened in season,
All beings were happy and practiced Dharma—
It was like competing with the Golden Age. Then, nourished by excellent food appropriate to his age, this youth, having performed great deeds for previous kings and created exceptional roots of virtue, possessed the marks of a great being: his body was beautiful and majestic like a water crystal, his face was fair, lustrous and immaculate, his hands and feet were soft like lotuses with broad joints, and so forth. It is said that from a very young age, he was respectful and devoted to his parents and elders, speaking politely, saying "I am well," showing a smiling face, and speaking clearly and pleasantly, among other excellent qualities.

From a very young age, he would not become distressed or timid when others threatened or confronted him. Unable to be disturbed by circumstances of suffering, when he heard there were Arhats at Mount Kailash, it is said he had extremely strong karmic imprints for Dharma, such as traveling on foot to those difficult-to-reach places.

When he reached seven years of age, he met with the omniscient lord of Dharma Kunga Zangpo - who was the great vajra master who perfectly embodied the sixth Vajradhara himself, the lord of all Buddha families, for the benefit of fortunate disciples - at glorious Sakya. He received various Dharma teachings including the complete lay precepts which are the root of the doctrine, and empowerment into Bhagavan Amitayus's mandala. He was given the name Arin Pel.

That master gave him a scented cotton robe that he had worn and prophesied: "Wear this and avoid obstacles. You will accomplish service to the Sakyapas."

His body possessed the marks of a hundred merits,
His speech was gentle and beneficial to others,
His mind was of excellent character, undisturbed by circumstances—
What is surprising about this, given his cultivation through lifetimes?

How wonderful that he received from the omniscient one's lips
The saffron robes of fragrant discipline,
Like those of the second great sala tree, the Mighty Sage,
Along with the nectar of well-spoken hundred precepts and prophecies.

Moreover, this great being from a young age could not be led to lowly places. Endowed with qualities such as relying on holy beings and natural intelligence, he effortlessly mastered all conventional sciences including reading, writing, mathematics and astrology. It is said that he was close to Dharma friends, spoke honestly, and was pleasant to associate with.

In particular, due to the force of habituation over many lifetimes, even when he was very young and studying reading and writing under Lama Rinrampa at the eastern palace, he would go to solitary places like Manjushri Cave and practice meditation. When he saw the thrones of the eastern lineage holders and the Dharma thrones on the white-washed walls, he would climb up on them, gather children his age and say "I will teach Dharma, you all listen!" He would constantly make gestures of teaching Dharma and practicing meditation.

He would perform the Chakrasamvara Guru Puja ritual during the eastern monthly offerings. When he observed someone doing a strict one-month retreat of Dorje Zhonnu at Sazang, he said "I too must practice such Dharma" - the thought arose vividly in his mind. When he saw many animals being slaughtered in front of Tongu temple, great immeasurable compassion arose in him. In particular, when he saw a thief from Upper Dragang having his eyes gouged out...

In particular, when he saw a thief from Upper Dragang having his eyes gouged out, spontaneous great compassion arose uncontrollably within him. He thought that if he could find a secluded place where he would not see such things, strong renunciation and weariness would arise continuously in his mind. These experiences naturally arose, and due to those conditions, he developed a strong aspiration for ordination, viewing samsara as a prison and liberation as a palace. He thought "When will I get to become a monk?" and while he found study and recitation easy, the thought repeatedly arose in his mind that he wished he could do genuine meditation practice. Furthermore, on one occasion when he saw the images of Manjushri at the Old Central Tower and the statue of Lord Yamantaka erected by Naro's Lord Yamantaka Drak, he developed great faith and devotion, wanting to make repeated prostrations and prayers. Later, when he saw the statue of the Precious Lord in the corner chamber, he said that exceptional and uncommon faith and devotion arose in him, thinking "This one is especially blessed. "

Thus appeared his inconceivable liberation story that transcended childish behavior. This accords with scripture as well, which states:
"Before engaging in practice,
Compassion, devotion, patience,
And authentic virtuous conduct
Should be known as signs of [spiritual] family. "

Therefore, it is natural that great beings from their earliest age gain mastery over many collections of qualities and fully develop the seeds of the perfectly endowed white family.

In one instance, when the honorable Kunga Wangchuk arrived to fulfill the intentions of the noble Vajradhara Zangpo, [Konchog Lhundrup] had a very strong wish to become ordained. He earnestly requested, "Please take me to Ngor for prostrations," to which [the master] replied, "When the time is right, Chen Sozang Pha will send you there, so come then. " Due to his young age, he was not given permission to go. For some time after that, whenever horseback-riding monks came from the east, he would wonder if it was the Drungchen. Whenever travelers from Ngor arrived, he would repeatedly ask them "Is Drungchen coming?" and so forth. In brief, just like the bodhisattva "Ever-Weeping" who sought the Dharma of Prajnaparamita without paying attention to food, drink, or clothing, and remained inseparable from contemplating only the Perfection of Wisdom while seeking the holy Dharma, this holy being, while still in his youth, eagerly sought ordination from household life to homelessness like a thirsty person seeking cool water. It is said that he was someone who played with intense and unceasing application day and night. Great beings naturally possess certain qualities even without training. Like the four great rivers adorned with jewel garlands - who can prevent them from flowing into the ocean? Having taken your seat upon the Dharma throne prepared for the sacred teachings, O aggregate of qualities, this path of upholding Shakyamuni's long tradition is the power of eons of familiarization.

From compassion for beings suffering
In samsara's crocodile-infested waters,
You sought the unequaled great ship
Of virtuous deeds for liberation's sake.
O wonder! You first found
The wish-fulfilling tree of universal love
That even ascetics wandering forest edges
And the Sage himself could not find.

Then, on the fourth day of the tenth month of the Hare year, when several attendants of the Drungchen arrived and were making torma offerings at the protector temples like Kyedlha and Gorum, I also went there. When I wondered if I would meet the Protector, I briefly lost consciousness due to great joy, faith and devotion. Though others said it was intimidating, I did not feel any fear at all. Upon meeting the statue of Sakya Pandita on top of Goru, great faith arose in me. Though it was without thought, he said I was able to recite several verses of the Dharmaraja prayer.

Then, traveling together with the Drungchen, they arrived at Ewam on the eighth day of the first month of the Female Earth Hare year. There they met with the great master Konchog Gyaltsen Pelzangpo, whose fame delighted all followers of the sugarcane lineage, who had attained the state of a great leader accomplishing the welfare and happiness of all beings through his inconceivable wisdom and immeasurable compassion.

The next day, when he came to give morning teachings, [Konchog Lhundrup] met him and requested blessings. When a tuft of hair fell from [the master's] hand onto his head, and when requesting blessings again on the return journey, as soon as the master placed his hand on his head, a monk of good health said something like "Your face. " Before he could finish, having received blessings for a long time, [Konchog Lhundrup] experienced inconceivable joy and delight in his mind. All the most wonderful naturally arising, spontaneously present dependent originations came together perfectly. Afterward, led by the Drungchen, they went before the master and offered ceremonial gifts. [The master] asked, "Are you the one who was requesting blessings earlier? Where are you from?" He replied, "From Sakya. " The Drungchen explained the reasons in detail. Having finished all the remaining lunch offerings of that day, [the master] said "Don't give these to others - eat them yourself" and was extremely pleased, it is said. Then on the eleventh day of the waxing phase of the victorious month, the holy supreme Muschen - who was inseparable from the Buddha, the sun for all beings - acted as preceptor, while the Dharma Lord Jamyang Sherab Gyatso Drakpa Pelzangpo, who displayed the dance of knowledge and love of Lord Ngawang, acted as master. In the midst of many assisting monks, having abandoned all worldly aspirations like spittle in the dust, he properly drew the qualities of liberation and enlightenment into his mindstream and received the pure novice monk's vows.

When bestowing his name, [the master] declared that it should be "Konchog Lhakpa" without making any additions. This was in accord with what was said in [...]. Having thus obtained initiation from that great vajra master who had abandoned all faults, through mantras, mudras, and samadhi, he was introduced into the qualified great mandala. Having planted the seeds of the four kayas in the four fundamental vajras, through the method of directly manifesting the wisdom indicated by empowerment, he attained the inner samvara of the inexpressible co-emergent state. Thereafter, all his physical, verbal, and mental activities and conduct without exception never wavered from the great vajra samaya of beginningless and endless bodhicitta, naturally pure primordial existence of Samantabhadra, which is the unity of bliss and emptiness. 

From the youthful fragrance of previous karmic potential,
Churning the ocean of compassion's reflection,
Bearing the burden of upholding the vast teachings,
The waves of ocean-like courage surge upward.

"You are worthy to be protector of limitless beings"—
Thus did the compassionate guru first arrange
Some naturally arising, spontaneously present connections,
And placed [him] first on the jeweled throne of the three vows.

Having thus received the kindness of the three vows from such a noble and excellent lord, like spreading a precious garland of the extraordinary lineage, he acted according to the saying:

"With proper conduct, learning and contemplation,
One should fully apply oneself to meditation."

1. Based on the foundation of pure discipline, properly training in the activities of the three wheels is the faultless activity of the doctrine that is suitable to be accomplished by renunciates, as explained by the wise. 2. Wishing to follow what was explained, regarding how he studied and contemplated the stainless treatises while relying on spiritual friends, when briefly described:

He also received the Vajrapāṇi Empowerment, Questions of Subāhu, General Secret Tantra, Dhāraṇī of Ratna Tālaka, Amitāyus Sūtra, and the Bhūtaḍamara Tantra. Furthermore, he received the Vajravidaraṇa Tantra, Vajrameru Kūṭāgāra Tantra, and the Purification of Qualities Tantra excellently and completely. In particular, regarding Hevajra's root and explanatory tantras, Cakrasaṃvara's root and explanatory tantras, Vajrabhairava Tantra, and Sarvadurgatipariśodhana Tantra, and Pratiṣṭhā Tantra, he excellently received and mastered the explanatory instructions that accord with the writings of the venerable Sakya fathers and sons. He received all the sacred Dharma teachings possessed by that Dharma Lord like a filled vase, and through his conduct, he pleased [his teacher] completely. [The teacher] considered him his supreme heart-son and was pleased to prophesy: "You will establish many auspicious connections for spreading the pure doctrine. "

Furthermore, wishing to accomplish the state of a fully ordained monk - whose qualities shine brightly like hundreds of billions of stars holding the disciplinary code, adorned with the complete aspects of the mandala of precious superior discipline made of crystal-like definite emergence, and beautified by the clearly defined lines of training in the three aspects of restrictions, preventions and permissions - in the Iron Male Rat year known as Savati in the Noble Land.

At the auspicious Ewam Chöden monastery, he received complete monastic ordination in the midst of ten faithful Sangha members, including:

1. The abbot, master of the complete doctrine, renowned among scholars, possessor of many qualities of accomplishment and knowledge-holders, the incomparable holy Dharma Lord Palden Dorje
2. The karma master who became like a second Buddha for the Buddhist doctrine, the crown jewel of all tantra expounders of the North, the omniscient Sönam Senge
3. The secret instructor, master Chöje Sönam Wangchuk
4. The time-calculation master Sangye Paldrub and others

Immediately after ordination, he became one with beautiful deportment, mindful and disciplined, with completely tamed and peaceful senses, conducting himself like one who had been fully ordained for a hundred years. Being supreme among monastics who were unstained by even the slightest infractions of the finest training rules, he was:

1. Like the great elder Katyayana, prophesied as supreme among those respectful of the training
2. Like Mahakashyapa, outstanding among those adorned with the qualities of purification
3. Like the noble Sroṇa Koṭikarṇa, praised as supreme among those of disciplined conduct who wandered for alms

He relied upon:
1. The middle way that abandons the two extremes
2. The producer of wisdom
3. Complete pacification
4. Higher perceptions
5. Perfect enlightenment
6. The state beyond sorrow.

From that very time onward, he made a strict vow to abstain from eating meat. Living by these strict precepts, he kept in mind the inconceivable faults of meat consumption taught in the sutras and tantras. Through the force of his boundless compassion, he made a vow to abstain from meat not just in this life but in all future lives. Not only did he himself not eat meat, he would not allow meat to be served to others in his presence, and he was extremely pleased when others took vows to abstain from meat. He would say, "Since this is a Mahayana precept, one should maintain the intention not to eat meat until attaining enlightenment. " He joyfully gave such instructions and made dedications accordingly. Through these extraordinary activities in the domain of the Buddha's conduct alone, he accomplished great works for the Buddha's teachings. Like an adorned victory banner of saffron robes, his body - created through many virtuous deeds - was bathed in the ocean of tens of thousands of Dharma disciplines, radiating the light of the three trainings. Free from even subtle attachments to existence and unmoved by the pleasures of desire gods, through your conduct of scholarly diligence, you perpetually upheld the tradition of the great Buddha's virtue. Furthermore, this Dharma Lord who was insatiable in his vast learning received teachings from the preceptor, the Dharma Lord Desar, including:

1. The precious teaching of Path with Its Fruits [Lamdre]
2. The Hevajra tradition of Saroruha
3. The condensed Guhyasamaja
4. The three Chakrasamvara traditions:
   4. 1 Krishna
   4. 2 Luipa
   4. 3 Drilbupa.

Here is the enumerated translation maintaining consistency with previous sections:

5. The Guhyasamaja tradition of Arya [Nagarjuna] and Jowo Je's tradition
6. Vajrabhairava with 49 deities
7. Tara with 17 deities 
8. The Kunrik tradition
9. The twelve purification mandalas

Along with many empowerments, permissions, explanatory teachings, and an extensive collection of oral transmissions including the collected works of the earlier masters. Furthermore, he studied for a long time at the lotus feet of the incomparable Lord of Dharma, the master of wisdom, the omniscient Sonam Senge, whose fame illuminated the three realms of existence. First, he completed his studies of:

1. The Abhisamayalankara with commentary
2. The Vinaya Sutra
3. The higher and lower Abhidharma
4. The Differentiation of the Three Vows and other main scriptural collections

Having completed these studies, he developed an unobstructed intellectual power like a great ship navigating the ocean of learning through analytical wisdom born of contemplation. He attained extraordinary intelligence that was swift, clear, vast and profound, surpassing others. He achieved perfect confidence that was fearless even when facing great opponents. Furthermore, beginning with the precious Oral Transmission [Gsung Ngag], he received:

1. The ripening empowerments of the three tantras - Hevajra, Chakrasamvara and Guhyasamaja - along with many minor auxiliary path instructions
2. The Ocean of Dakinis Chakrasamvara
3. Both Guru traditions
4. Both Yamantaka traditions and other empowerments
5. The three Red Cycle teachings
6. Many types of permissions for the major and minor Dharma protectors
7. Explanations of the generation and completion stages of both Hevajra and Chakrasamvara tantras.

Many minor scriptural transmissions and teachings that were previously received from the earlier lords, as well as numerous profound and vast holy Dharma teachings not received from them but from that Dharma Lord's collected works, were received and [he] was blessed as the foremost among disciples.

Furthermore, from the emanation of Lord Manjushri, the great master Chumikpa Lodro Wangchuk, he received various Dharma teachings including the Clear Realization of the Sage [Thubpa Gongsal] and the Great Bodhicitta Generation instruction. From Master Sonam Wangchuk, he also received the empowerment of the forty-five mandalas of Vajramala with Kriya, and various holy Dharma teachings including the transmission of the Three Garland Cycles, thus becoming a great ocean of learning.

How wonderful! From the great ocean of the speech of many scholars,
The four great rivers of excellent explanations flow in succession.
Having made their residence in the vast expanse of mind,
They became vessels for millions of precious virtues.
Therefore, you alone are the water treasury of the perfect teachings,
Which the skilled captain seeking liberation
Can fill with the great ship of faith,
And are the dwelling place for hosts of bright-minded beings.

Thus, having attended for a long time at the feet of many holy beings who were both learned and accomplished, and insatiably drinking the nectar of their speech, he developed clear intelligence capable of analyzing even the most subtle and profound points of scripture, reasoning, and essential instructions, along with single-pointed faith that viewed spiritual mentors as the Teacher.

Having developed single-pointed faith that viewed spiritual mentors as the Teacher, and through the power of possessing unsurpassed diligent aspiration to understand both words and meaning, he mastered most fields of knowledge renowned among scholars. Regarding how he put their meaning into practice: First, considering the precious training of higher moral discipline to be the root of the teachings, he discerned what to adopt and abandon down to the finest details of all the training grounds. He perfected even the appropriate signs and appearance according to the proper measure, and made all his conduct accord solely with the holy Dharma Vinaya. In particular, due to the force of natural familiarity with virtue through many lives of existence, even from a young age he naturally committed not even the slightest wrongdoing. How could he possibly be stained by even a trace of what contradicts these [precepts] after growing up and mastering the precious trainings? This is proven by direct valid cognition through his reliance on the four purities: livelihood to be relied upon, moral discipline to be protected, conduct to be practiced, and view to be realized. How is this evident? It was apparent to all that he dwelt solely with controlled and peaceful body, speech and mind, possessed of mindfulness. All his modes of conduct were beautiful and dignified, the special fragrance of his moral discipline wafted even in unwanted directions, and all places where he resided became clean and delightful.

Here from the pristine fragrance he possessed, it was seen that he never showed even the slightest hostility toward anyone, nor did he speak harsh or cutting words, nor display any unpleasant expressions toward others. This was because he completely lacked any thoughts or intentions of deceiving others through attachment to gain and honor. Therefore, among those intellectuals who were in his presence, none ever witnessed anything that could be considered a fault in any of this great being's activities and conduct of body, speech and mind. From his own words: "Although as a complete beginner in spiritual practice, it is difficult to perfectly accomplish all the karmic causes and effects to be adopted and abandoned, I have at least some conviction in karma. " This was directly evident. For this reason, it is explained that spending time engaged in conduct that pleases the Victor through faith in karma, which is called "worldly right view," is also a sign of non-regression. As the noble master Aryadeva stated: "For one who possesses the great worldly right view, it is impossible to go to lower realms even in a thousand eons. " But that is not all - this Dharma Lord's mind was completely filled with the essence of great compassion that cherishes others more than self. He showed universal love toward all beings as if they were his only child, and especially toward the poor and destitute, those without protectors, and those afflicted by severe illness and suffering.

Through his great compassion that was especially stirred toward those whose minds were defiled by strong attachment to worldly activities, he provided excellent provisions of food, clothing and other necessities to any lowly beings in need. By speaking words suited to each person's mindset and giving them encouragement, he guided them solely toward methods for happiness and wellbeing in this and future lives. Even for those whose minds were confused by strong attachment to different philosophical views and tenets, through his great loving approach skilled in methods, and through special intimate discourse endowed with profound meaning and perfect words, he had unobstructed confidence in leading them to the unmistaken path without relying on others. Thus he caused the ocean of disciples' faith to completely expand. As Lord Maitreya stated: "Impartial, wishing to benefit, compassionate, greatly frightened by beings' suffering arising, well-striving in taming beings, and extremely far from the three faults of speech. " Contemplating these qualities, the learned ones also completely praised him saying: "I bow at the feet of the holy being endowed with pure conduct of discipline and learning, definitely peaceful and adorned with supreme wisdom, beautified by the glory of complete gentleness. " As for the stages of inner tantric practice and how he conducted himself, since it appears he mainly kept these hidden from others, the details are not available.

If speaking of what is commonly known and what appeared to him directly: He held the root of the path - the samaya vows and commitments - as dear as his life force, remaining completely unstained by the pollution of transgressions. From within a state inseparable from the profound essential practice of the indivisible samsara and nirvana - which he realized as being indescribable as either identical to or different from self-aware primordial wisdom that sees phenomena as illusion-like dependent origination, and the dharmadhatu free from elaborations like space that pacifies all dualistic confusion - he maintained an exceptional devotion and constant application that could not be disturbed by any outer or inner distractions. He clearly devoted himself constantly to many stages of formal and formless practices, primarily focused on the profound path of Guru Yoga, the root of all accomplishments. In particular, in the Year of the Dragon, after receiving the complete annual cycle of Path and Result [Lamdre] teachings from the great omniscient one, he properly maintained all experiences as progressive guidance. During the generation stage practices of that system, he performed the fire offerings along with one-tenth of the 400,000 recitations. At other times, he also diligently performed approach, accomplishment, offerings, torma rituals, fulfillment and confession practices for many yidam deities and dharma protectors such as Bhagavan Yamantaka and the greater and lesser Vajra Mahakala. Based on this, it was evident that the gurus and yidams focused their attention and blessings on him single-pointedly, and the dakinis and dharma protectors accomplished all activities effortlessly.

When he heard the reading transmission of the praise to the Venerable Precious One during his youth, a special clear vision and definite knowing that the Great Venerable One was present right there arose for a long time. Due to this cause, even later when he experienced illness and other difficulties, merely by praying one-pointedly to that very one, all signs of obstacles would immediately be dispelled. When Lord Kunga Wangchuk passed away, he took responsibility for many outer and inner activities including the placement of the kudung (holy remains). He directly witnessed many amazing events, such as how the dharma protectors like Putra remained inseparably present at the temple housing the kudung and accomplished activities. 

Through the power of his diligent practice of the profound path, he manifested limitless samadhis and many aspects of dependent origination. Due to his skill in methods for generating unborn samadhi in others' mindstreams and enhancing what had already arisen, when some experienced sudden obstacles like imbalanced elements, he could remove those obstacles immediately just by giving one empowerment. For those afflicted by illness and negative forces, by merely giving blessings and consecrated water, their immediate recovery was directly witnessed. For any monk or patron, if they practiced exactly according to the master's instructions regarding what to adopt and abandon, it would become solely a cause for excellence both temporarily and ultimately.

If one practiced incorrectly, it would be different from before. For some patrons of lower family lineage, when he granted auspicious connections, those aims would manifest without obstruction. He appeared to have mastery over many kinds of wisdom and objects of wisdom that were difficult for ordinary beings to fathom. Although he seemed to possess many such extremely wonderful qualities of enlightened activity, because he was very humble and extremely reserved, no one could ask him about these, and even if asked he would never speak clearly about them. He repeatedly stated that aspects of his personal practice and such things were not at all suitable to explain to others. Even just considering these aspects of his life story, I think he possessed amazing deeds that became objects of complete trust for noble beings endowed with critical analysis. As it is said:

"Though entering the path of the secret mantra Vajrayana,
Not knowing the outer and inner samayas,
When carelessly speaking about secret samayas,
The result becomes as distant as east from west.
Like a wish-fulfilling jewel at the fearsome precipice,
Those wishing to practice the precious instructions
Of the glorious and powerful master Virupa
Should perfect the conduct endowed with the ten secrets."

Since he put these teachings into practice in accordance with their meaning...

Worthy of close reliance by the learned who strive in discipline,
Your excellent conduct is like a garland of lotuses, naturally gentle,
Your fragrant scent of virtue alone brings satisfaction
To the hearts of wise bees.

Through the continuous three paths of love and compassion for limitless beings,
Skilled in filling the wish-fulfilling trees of fortunate minds,
Having cleansed all defilements of beings in the three realms,
None other has reached the ocean of the two purposes.

The arrows of words that bring pain to others' minds,
And acts called "teaching" through shooting many arrows at others -
The dust of anger weighed down by hundreds of mountains of pride
Was washed away elsewhere by your compassion's waters.

Supreme abode of the learned, disciplined, and powerful siddhas
Who strike fear in the asura armies of conceptual signs,
Sustained by the nectar food of the two stages,
You alone are lord of the great secret assembly.

Having completed the recitation of vidya-mantras and svasti,
You achieved power pleasing to the lords of dakinis.
In the joy of seeing the moonlike assembly of siddhas,
I join my palms in respect hundreds of times.

Regarding how he turned the wheel of enlightened activities and deeds: I have heard that from his youth, this master of ours never harmed others' minds and made all their hopes fruitful. Even when asked for advice and such, he only employed methods that would not harm others and would solely benefit and bring happiness to all directions. Thus everyone regarded him as authoritative, and whatever conduct he engaged in through meditative equipoise and post-meditation became solely for others' benefit - how could it be otherwise? Nevertheless, for the sake of preventing the Buddha's teachings from declining and causing them to flourish...

Nevertheless, for the sake of preventing the Buddha's teachings from declining and causing them to flourish, from around the age of thirty, he taught whatever appropriate Dharma to fortunate disciples who sought meaning, while primarily focusing on the profound practice of the two stages.

At that time, all the assembled sangha made requests with one mind, and primarily through the Great Omniscient One's permission, at age forty-two, in the Male Fire Horse year known as Zilnön in the Noble Land, on the twenty-fifth day of the Saga month, he was empowered as the regent of the great Sixth Vajradhara, the all-knowing Lord Zangpo. Led by the Great Omniscient One, the entire assembly consecrated him with auspicious ceremonies, and even the deities in the sky made offerings by showering great rains of flowers, thus empowering him as the great master of the teachings.

Thus as regent of the Second Buddha, the Dharma Lord Palden Zangpo,
The Omniscient Sun of Dharma bestowed empowerment,
And the assembly offered auspicious celebrations.
At that time, the gods of the white side in ultimate Akanishtha,
Extending their reverent hands, declared
"This protector of fortunate gods and humans is worthy of offerings"
And scattered fresh divine flowers in worship.

From then on, for twenty-eight uninterrupted years, fortunate disciples gathered like clouds from Upper Ngari, Lower Dokham, and Central Ütsang, to whom he continuously gave vast Dharma teachings appropriate to each one's capacity. Each year during winter...

Each winter he would bestow a complete teaching cycle of the precious instruction of the Path with its Result [Lamdre], the primary tradition of the glorious great master Virūpa, lord of the ten powers, along with all associated instructions including generating bodhicitta, empowerments, blessings, oral instructions, transmissions, and detailed practical guidance.

During summer, he extensively taught many precious tantras in accordance with the exegetical tradition of the venerable Sakya forefathers as previously mentioned in the record of teachings received, including the three great root and explanatory tantras of Hevajra, the root and explanatory tantras of Cakrasamvara for the assembly, and the Sarvadurgatipariśodhana Tantra.

During spring, autumn and other interim periods, he bestowed numerous empowerments of Hevajra, Cakrasamvara, Guhyasamaja, Yamāntaka, Vajrabhairava and others, along with many associated generation and completion stage instructions, explanations of minor texts, practical guidance, blessings, authorizations, and countless mind-transmissions. He also gave numerous scriptural transmissions including the complete Vajrayāna canon and collected works of previous masters, in accordance with each disciple's inclinations.

For those to be trained through common paths, he gave many instructions for training in bodhicitta including the bodhisattva vows from the great traditions of Madhyamaka and Cittamatra, the Four Dharmas of Gampopa, various mind training teachings of Mahāyāna, and the Six Texts of the Kadampa tradition.

The Sixteen Minor Scriptures, Twenty Precepts, and numerous other texts teaching bodhisattva conduct were taught at appropriate times, making the mental continuums of disciples extremely receptive and causing them to develop the sprouts of the two types of precious bodhicitta. As for those seeking ordination vows - the root of the teachings - except for occasional visitors, each regular yearly session would attract over a hundred aspirants. For all of them, through their respective pure rituals, he established the seeds of liberation by having them cultivate pure renunciation discipline, the number of which is immeasurable. In whatever he did, he kept only the welfare of the teachings and beings in his heart, never engaging in simplified rituals or easy practices, but rather granting teachings tirelessly despite his busy schedule through strict observance of what to adopt and abandon. This is a wondrous life story worthy of praise by the wise.

In brief, from among the various aspects of the holy Dharma mentioned above, whether:
1. Bestowing the stream of ripening empowerments
2. Teaching the liberating guidance instructions 
3. Elucidating the meaning of tantras through the six parameters and four modes
4. Granting profound blessings of the oral lineage
5. Conferring vows through pure rituals

Whatever teaching activity he performed, just as he had trained in that alone...

In terms of teaching qualities, he possessed all positive attributes such as:
1. Using words that were easy to grasp and pleasant to hear
2. Delivering profound essential meanings that conveyed definitive truth
3. Skillfully connecting both words and meaning in ways easy to understand

He abandoned all faults of teaching such as:
1. Not teaching
2. Teaching incorrectly
3. Teaching with doubt
4. Teaching with emotional bias of attachment or aversion
5. Teaching with uneven delivery

Through purely conducting his three doors (body, speech, and mind), he taught:
1. Deep and vast for those of great intelligence
2. Easy to grasp and understand for those of lesser capacity
3. Connecting words and meanings externally
4. Analyzing subtle points and their relationships

He thoroughly explained all teachings with their reasons and meanings, finally summarizing their essential points in a way that both learned and ignorant students could easily understand and practically apply. In this way of teaching, such a great master was unmatched by others, and in explaining any aspect of texts or meaning, he truly embodied the enlightened speech of the Omniscient One. During these occasions, as it is said:
"Encourage the discouraged,
Explain the faults of samsara to the excited,
And for the dull, through telling
Wonderful stories, make them listen. "

Thus, through many amazing stories and spontaneous humor and jest, he would inspire enthusiasm. At all times, he would teach about the faults of samsara, praise of moral discipline, benefits of study and contemplation, and life stories of spiritual friends.

Particularly, through his pleasing and eloquent teachings, he continuously spoke about the great qualities of the venerable Sakyapa forefathers, how they established the traditions of the doctrine, and how these should be upheld and maintained. Thus he caused the faith and intellectual faculties of disciples to fully develop in every way.

Considering these meaningful qualities, he was praised thus:
"Homage to you, the guru with the Dharma eye,
Who sits upon the precious steps of faith and diligence,
Who especially satisfies those lacking Dharma,
Who holds the key to the secret treasury of all tantras."

While seated on the profound and vast Dharma throne,
For faithful disciples of the three regions of Ü, Tsang and Kham,
For twenty-eight years without interruption, he turned the wheel of Dharma.
Through pure empowerments, he planted seeds of the four kāyas,
Through profound and vast guidance, he taught the nectar of immortality,
Through six parameters and four modes, he revealed the treasure of tantric meaning,
Through excellent discipline of precepts, he made the Buddha's teachings shine like day.
Therefore, by the sunlight of his wisdom,
Opening hundred-petaled flowers of excellent teachings,
Skilled in showing the essential meaning and words,
There is none other like you, holy Nyima.

Thus, having mastery over the precious continent of the three qualities of being learned, disciplined and noble, his reputation of establishing himself and others in complete liberation spread in all directions like fragrant perfume, becoming the crown jewel of all beings in the northern regions of Jambudvīpa.

Through inconceivable special wealth and based on manifest offerings, though all material enjoyments expanded like clouds in the golden age, far from pride and arrogance, he had not even the slightest attachment. All resources that came into his possession were entirely dedicated to the Guru, Three Jewels, Dharma, and sentient beings, without keeping even a sesame seed for himself. Moreover, he kept far away from all activities of false spiritual friends who engage in wrongdoing, such as: allowing his own attendants and relatives to carelessly use offerings made by others, maintaining unnecessary resources with hopes of appearing virtuous, seeking further gains through gains already received, and attracting householders through monastic resources and other wrong livelihoods that bind both self and others to great faults through impure giving.

With great care to ensure that faithful offerings were not wasted and practitioners would not incur faults, he generously gave to supreme places and for the sake of the Dharma and sentient beings without holding back. Thus, for the purpose of fulfilling the intention of the venerable holy Kunga Wangchuk, [he offered] his personal quarters with a life-sized golden statue, and an amazing gandola containing a thirteen-cubit-high inner support statue of Buddha Amitābha.

The same master offered a life-sized golden statue for his personal quarters, along with an amazing gandola containing a thirteen-cubit-high inner support statue of Buddha Amitābha, and an external round stupa equal in size to the stupas of the previous masters - all completed within one year. For the inner support of the Jina's image at Tubten Namgyal, he personally provided most of the materials and offerings for constructing a statue of the Lord of Sages and a replica for the quarters. He took responsibility for all supervision and management. For his personal meditation practice, he commissioned many golden statues of the profound path's guru lineage, a special statue of the Venerable Precious One made from white sandalwood offered by the King of Nepal, and exquisitely crafted statues of the Three Red Deities made from red sandalwood, complete with a shrine adorned with various precious ornaments. He also established numerous receptacles containing holy relics, and countless essential texts including the Three Tantras and golden volumes of Lamdre teachings.

Through perfectly pure consecration rituals, he made these blaze with the glory of auspiciousness and blessings. He worked solely for the long-lasting duration of the Victor's teachings and for beings' happiness and wellbeing. Furthermore, at the great monastic seat of glorious Sakya, he made repeated offerings of countless butter lamps, each blazing as large as a chariot wheel, using hundreds of measures of butter. He performed services such as offering tea to the great assembly and other veneration.

At the three supports [of body, speech, and mind], he made countless offerings of robes, silk scarves, and other offering materials. Similarly, at the Jo bo Avalokiteśvara of Zar Byang Phug and at the temple of Sukhāvatī at Ling Kha, he repeatedly offered butter lamp garlands, robes, silk scarves, and other items. When great epidemics and famines spread throughout all the land of snow, causing many beings to suffer from hunger, he extensively provided food and vegetables. Based on his reputation, countless poor and destitute people gathered even from far-off places. To all of them, he provided excellent provisions of vegetables, food, and other necessities of life continuously for months, liberating many beings from the suffering of hunger and thirst. For those studying tantras during summer, he provided tantric allowances. At all times, he fulfilled all the wishes of disciples through the four means of gathering and six perfections by giving appropriate Dharma teachings and provisions to those practitioners lacking necessities who were dedicated to study, contemplation, and meditation practice. Through Dharma-concordant guidance, he established them in vast benefit and happiness for this and future lives, like a wish-fulfilling jewel, a king of power that is the source of all needs and wants. In the temples of this monastery too, he offered many garlands of blazing butter lamps around the circumference.

In his great assembly, he enriched the offering materials with marvelous arrangements of appropriate parasols, victory banners, pennants, canopies, and musical instruments. Most of these manifest offering materials were accomplished through the entirely pure activities and enlightened work of this venerable holy one, who is inseparable from the Victor's son Samantabhadra. Furthermore, he newly established some monthly offerings of the previous masters, and continuously increased the annual and monthly offerings that had existed from the beginning.

During those times too, he established both self and others in virtuous paths through vast magnificent deeds such as offering countless rows of butter lamp garlands. He also created a great pathway for disciples to engage in extensive roots of virtue.

Through the power of his well-done virtuous deeds ripening:
Like abundant desired fruits of excellence expanding greatly,
Enjoying happiness through Dharma and material wealth,
Even in this degenerate age, unlike others' actions,
Through self-interest and overwhelming compassion,
Not leading self and others onto wrong paths,
Benefiting beings through the four means of gathering -
Like teaching others the conduct of Bodhisattvas.
Like the conduct of glorious Samantabhadra,
The manifold activities of the three wheels
Worthy of praise by the wise and learned
Are like nectar for the eyes of observers.

Having spent his life engaged solely in such pure deeds and activities of the three wheels, in the latter part of autumn in the Male Water Monkey year, his physical strength diminished slightly due to the power of fatigue and weakness. At that time, he sent a letter to the great Muchen at Lingkhar saying "My physical form is not well, so come without hesitation."

From the swift coursing of aspirations of Kunga Zangpo, who is the ocean of wisdom and compassion of all Victors, arose the cooling rays of enlightened activity. The great master whose emanated form of light appeared from the undiminished mandala of Lokeśvara's compassion, completely pervading the ocean-like minds of suitable disciples to be trained - to name him for the purpose of meaning - "My master, the venerable great being, Buddha Rinchen Palzangpo," whose renowned fame spread to all directions. He swiftly arrived at E-waṃ. In the auspicious conjunction of the Royal and Jupiter stars on the morning of the tenth day of the miracle month in the Female Wood Bird year called "Glorious Face," he was empowered as regent. From that very day, he began the winter teachings. From the second month, the Lord himself entered into retreat, focusing single-pointedly on profound spiritual practice. After emerging from retreat, during the summer teachings, the emanation body of the one known as "Glorious Vajratīkṣṇa," who is the essence that unifies the wisdom appearances of all Victors, the lord of the ten grounds - the glorious Sakya Lotsāwa Jamyang Kunga Sönam Drakpa...

Having become renowned as "Venerable Jamyang Kunga Sönam Drakpa Gyaltsen Palzangpo," he acted as the principal supplicant. Led by the three venerable brothers, the incomparable great hermit whose wisdom was inseparable from Lokeśvara, along with many high-ranking masters who possessed authority over numerous extraordinary religious and secular affairs, and many spiritual friends who were masters of scripture and reasoning, he bestowed the extremely extensive and complete instructions of the precious Path with the Result (Lamdré) to about six hundred members of the Sangha with great care. He granted innumerable ordinations of both novice and full monks, causing the Buddha's teachings to shine like moonlight upon a field of kumuda flowers. The material offerings received were comparable to those of the Perfect Age. The prosperity of both religious and secular gatherings of spiritual friends and high-ranking masters became renowned as particularly great in these times. In brief, this venerable holy master gave the precious Path with the Result teachings twenty-eight times to the great assembly. Once to a small group upon request by the Abbot of Godong, and once at Tsedong Sidsum Namgyal in the Male Wood Rat year, thus leading with a total of thirty complete transmissions of the Path with the Result. He taught empowerments, permissions, oral transmissions, pith instructions, tantra explanations and so forth as appropriate to each occasion, and during the intervals between teachings, he maintained extremely strict retreats.

Through complete dedication to one-pointed resting in profound samadhi that could not be disturbed by any gross or subtle distractions, he spent his entire life solely engaged in teaching and practice. Based on how the fresh fragrance of his pure activities and enlightened deeds pervaded all directions, numerous powerful protectors who showed devotion to the doctrine and its holders revered him as an object of veneration. All the holy beings of supreme learning and accomplishment renowned as great throughout the Land of Snows untied all knots of pride and respectfully placed his immaculate feet upon the crown of their heads, enjoying the feast of the holy Dharma. He had countless learned disciples, and through long-term partaking of the nectar of his speech, he produced many unequaled chief spiritual sons whose faith and intelligence had fully matured. Among his renowned disciples who performed vast activities for the doctrine, to mention a few: the Lord of Infinite Compassion, Regent of the Victorious Ones, Venerable Holy Great Muspa, and the Second Omniscient One of the Degenerate Age, Great Abbot Sönam Lhundrup Lekpai Jungné Gyaltsen Palzangpo.

Born into the immaculate lineage of the glorious Sakyapa, and enriched with numerous precious qualities, the four brothers including the great master Chöjé Sönam Gyaltsen Palzangpo, and the four brothers including the great master Precious Jamyang Chökyi Gyalpo Kunga Sönam Drakpa Gyaltsen Palzangpo - these eight holy beings born into the Khön lineage were like immaculate crown jewels for all beings in the northern continent of Jambudvīpa. They touched his lotus feet, along with many other great scholars who maintained the holy tradition at the great monastic colleges of:
1. Zhalu
2. Glorious Khor Dé Chen:
   - Khenchen Khyenrab Wangchuk Könchok Tsultrimpa
3. Nartang:
   - Khenchen Rinpoche Sherab Palden
4. Dradong:
   - Khenchen Zhunggyasmawa Rinchen Palzangpo

And many other masters including:
1. From Kyetsal:
   - Chöjé Khedrub Norbu Phuntsok
   - Supreme scholar Lhawang Lodrö
2. From Sermokchen:
   - Chöjé Khyentsé's lord Kunga Gyaltsen
   - His younger brother, the great being Sönam Gyaltsen
3. From Thubten:
   - Chöjé Panchen Wangchuk Drubpa Palzangpo and his seat-holders
4. From Yangpachen:
   - Chöjé Murabjampa Jampa Thujé Palzangpo and his two seat-holders
   
And many other crown ornaments of scholars who were masters of scripture and reasoning, and others including Chöjé Rinpoche Chentsabpa Tsultrim Zangpo.

The incomparable great ascetic Kunga Chokden and his brothers, along with the unequaled Lord Lhachok Sengge who was the crown ornament of many Vajra-holders seated on the throne of Ewam Chöden, the great scholar-adept Muchen Namkha Palzang, the Panchen of Nyuk-la Ngawang Chöden Jikme Nyempa'i De, and the lord of yogis Kunpang Chökyi Nyima, along with many others who had reached the far shore of the ocean of scriptural knowledge like knowledge-holders, and furthermore, from Upper Ngari, many spiritual friends including Zhide Chöjé Jamyang Namkha Tenpa and Nanga Rigpa Namgyal Palzangpo.

Along with many abbots from the monasteries of Lodrak Samling and Tengchen Dulwa Domsum Ling, Jampa Ling, and the precious abbots of the three monasteries of Dolpo Jatsang Mo, Cham Chözom, and Jang Gön, and contemporaneous abbots of various monastic colleges of upper and lower Ngari such as Namling Chöjé Panchen Kunga Lodrö - all followers of this tradition were made direct disciples. Furthermore, there were Kyomda Chöjé Lhawang Lodrö and his seat-holders, the great Tharpa and his seat-holders, Amgön Rabjampa Gyaltsen Rinchen and his seat-holders, Chöbum Kachu Tsultrim Özer, the uncle-nephew pair of Sermok Chöjé Gedün Sengge.

Among his disciples, there were great teachers in Upper and Lower Do Kham including the famous Papong Chöjé Choklang Sarma, Chöjé Namkha Chokzangpa and his seat-holders, Neji Chöjé Rinchen Wangchukpa, Gépelwa Chöjé Jangchub Gyaltsenpa, and Dusi Lama Tingdzin Özerpa. An inconceivable number of great holy scholars and accomplished masters resided there who illuminated the teachings. Though I have faith and respect for all of them, how could one possibly write all their names, as they are far too numerous? In brief, during that time, countless thousands of spiritual friends endowed with the three qualities of being learned, ethical, and noble touched the stainless jewel-dust of his toenails with their crowns. Having received the kindness of his instructions and guidance, they made the Buddha's teachings shine ever brighter like rays of sunlight through teaching, debating, composing, and practice. Their countless disciples, grand-disciples, and great-grand-disciples filled this great maṇḍala of the earth. Having planted seeds of virtuous Dharma in the countless beings who saw, heard, or thought of him, he established them definitively in the lineage of unsurpassed enlightenment. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the great Vajradhara masters and their spiritual heirs.

His virtuous deeds, like a garland of flowers,
Are carried by wise and clear-minded bees that captivate the mind.
His fame, like a fragrant breeze, adorns
The great earth of the Buddha's teachings as an ornament.

Like the elixir of immortality resting in the hands
Of the beautiful one who moves through the three realms,
He gradually taught the great path of profound, peaceful, non-elaborated nectar,
The essence of the great secret instructions.

Like the lord of wheels, the essence of the assembled Sugatas,
His body blazed with the light of samādhi's power.
Like the full moon among the stars,
He shone brilliantly among many learned and disciplined ones.

Just as the inner sun of perfect vision
Opens the lotus hearts of many scholars,
You, whose speech-rays are without rival,
Have risen as the glory of the Snow Land's teachings in this age.

Then, on the waxing moon of the royal month, the patrons and disciples arrived from Kham with abundant and flawless offerings. Many faithful and wealthy students from Kham prepared numerous tea offerings. He regularly attended their dedication ceremonies and listened to their offering letters. He bestowed many dharmic favors upon the patron-disciples by replenishing their depleted resources and giving empowerments, blessings, and permissions to new monks. Until five days before his passing, he continuously taught the holy Dharma without interruption. He fulfilled all the various instructions and grants that needed to be given.

On the fifth day of the miracle month in the male Wood Dog year, he entered retreat. From that time, due to dietary and other conditions, his health slightly declined. Although whatever possible rituals and treatments were performed,

His activities generated renunciation in disciples attached to permanence, encouraged the diligent ones who were lazy, and temporarily completed his activities in this realm.

Considering that there were many disciples to be trained in other realms, he entered retreat. On the morning of the fifth day, at the special time when outer and inner ḍākinīs gather, he clearly established the profound yoga of passing as taught in the precious tantras. He displayed the way of dissolving the form body visible to ordinary beings into the dharmadhātu.

From then until the twenty-third day, his complexion became extraordinarily different from before. Between the twenty-third and twenty-fifth days, that sudden radiance in his face faded, and his appearance seemed not greatly changed from before. Then for half a month, he directly manifested the profound samādhi where the emptiness endowed with all supreme aspects and the supreme unchanging great bliss merged as one taste. With all elaborations pacified, he rested evenly in the state of mahāmudrā luminosity free from all extremes and center. Finally, arising from luminosity as the unity body, he undoubtedly departed for Sukhāvatī realm accompanied by an assembly of many ḍākas and ḍākinīs who came to welcome him.

Moreover, in previous conversations, when he went to view the relics during the time another great being departed for the benefit of others, he had an audience with the great accomplished master Namkha Palzang, who said: "I have made a commitment not to meet with anyone at the end of this life. The Guru father and sons reside in Sukhāvatī. If you wish to meet, we can meet in Sukhāvatī." Because he had said this, aspirations were made.

When aspirations were made, he said "Even in death there is no regret. " At that time when he was passing, while the great omniscient master of Glo-bo was residing in a very secluded retreat, he clearly saw signs of many devas who said they were from Sukhāvatī, arranging a welcoming procession saying they were coming to invite the Dharma Lord Ngorpa to Sukhāvatī. Therefore, at the conclusion of his ocean of activities:

"Accompanied by millions of vīras and ḍākinīs,
He manifestly departed for Sukhāvatī realm. Homage to you who perfected pure appearances!"

He praised him thus and said "These signs appeared to me as well. " Although there are some other liberation stories that arose from this, for now just this much has been expressed. In general, it appears this lord had already formed the intention to depart for Sukhāvatī around this time, as evidenced by his previous instruction to those gathering offerings: "You must definitely stay for four years. Until then, I will make aspirations that no faults occur whether at the monastery or elsewhere. " The timing matched with this instruction. On the day he entered retreat, he gave many specific instructions and advice that seemed like future predictions to most who arrived at his feet. Although he gave many instructions demonstrating his knowledge and consideration for each individual, no one understood them at that time. Later, upon reflection, everyone gained certainty about everything that had transpired.

On the twenty-fifth day, they arranged the kudung (holy remains) ceremonies. They offered extensive services and offerings. Around fifty monastics made continuous prayers. At the later month's memorial service, the regent of the Victor - the venerable great Mupa - and the two Dagchen Rinpoche Jamyang brothers presided. With approximately four thousand monastics, for many days they performed extensive cloud-like offerings, opened the five great maṇḍalas and made prayers, and properly conducted offerings, distributions, and acts of generosity. At the great seats of glorious Sakya, Nālendra, the various colleges of Tsang region, and the upper and lower Mu monasteries, they performed extensive commemorative ceremonies as appropriate for each. At this monastery itself, they established regular annual and monthly offerings, thus completely fulfilling his enlightened intentions in the dharmadhātu. Furthermore, patron-disciples from various regions offered butter lamps for the kudung ceremonies and excellent offerings for fulfilling his intentions. Faithful disciples residing in other regions of upper and lower Tibet and Guna also performed many kinds of virtuous deeds preceded by devoted faith focused on the qualities of the supreme venerable one, such as making offerings according to their means to fulfill his intentions and maintaining regular annual and monthly offerings.

Through disciplining his students' body, speech, mind, and all their enjoyments, he directed everything solely toward meaningful purposes. From the time of his passing until the completion of the ceremonies fulfilling his enlightened intentions, there were no winds, dust storms, or other disturbances. In the completely clear sky, many rainbow lights gathered and a continuous shower of divine flowers fell, which was visible to all. At times, sweet fragrances pervaded all directions, and everywhere near where the precious kudung resided, there were only exceptional aromas and other inconceivable miraculous signs and displays that caused disciples' minds to become even more devoted and faithful. At that time, the earth was free from dust storms,
Rainbow garlands gathered in the cloudless sky,
Sweet divine incense pervaded all directions,
And a great shower of divine flowers continuously fell. Through such wondrous signs and miraculous displays,
This earth's expanse was completely filled. Though attaining the unchanging dharmakāya,
For disciples' sake, you displayed the manner of departing as the all-pervading lord of wheels. Alas! The lamp of the three worlds has gone to rest!
The sun of profound and vast holy Dharma has set!
The compassionate moon of loving-kindness has disappeared!
Here the world has suddenly fallen into darkness!

Oh! The wish-fulfilling jewel is lost!
The aspirations of disciples seeking liberation have faded!
The unfailing supreme holy refuge has passed into peace. Henceforth, who can we protectorless ones rely upon?.

In seeing such circumstances as these,
How has such confusion entered my foolish heart
That still does not feel weariness with samsara?
O Lord of Dharma, please protect me with your compassion!

Where has the lama gone - the sole refuge of beings,
Who possessed a body of pure discipline free from misdeeds,
Speech that showered the nectar of oral transmission,
And a mind that loved all beings like children?

With singular aspirations focused on the teachings,
You engaged in conduct pleasing to the Victorious Ones. Your loving smile, skilled in clearly showing what to adopt and abandon without error,
Repeatedly captivates the mind. Like desiring cool water when tormented by thirst
Or when drops of heat pierce the heart,
When tormented by negative companions and the sufferings of existence,
I especially remember you, my protector. Born in this degenerate time due to negative karma,
I, this confused one, have no other hope. Whatever realm of samsara I may be born into,
Please look upon me with your compassion, venerable lama. Those childish ones who follow only delusion
Are deceived by grasping at truth. You taught that the root of suffering,
Grasping at truth, must be reversed. All phenomena of samsara and nirvana are mere appearances of one's own mind. The mind itself is clear light, the actual deity and guru. Therefore, while the essential guru remains,
Even grief at the guru's passing is delusion. By seeing your face, attachment to sensory appearances is reversed. By recognizing one's true nature, the root of grasping is cut. Through familiarization with non-grasping, to the state of unified vajra,
I will rely upon the essential guru who leads the way.

When the days [of cremation] were complete, six vajra-holders performed uninterrupted ritual offerings to the kudung (holy remains), including the Hevajra sādhana and guru pūja. On the morning of the twenty-first day of the first month, when the fire offering (cremation) was performed for the kudung, many wondrous signs appeared. Extensive offerings were made to the kudung while it remained in the reliquary chamber. After one month, when the reliquary chamber was opened, the cremation ashes were found to be completely filled with relics. Countless amazing relics also emerged from the previously existing teeth and vermillion from his nose.

Subsequently, many images of the Yogeśvara (Lord of Yoga) were made from the kudung remains. These were distributed as objects of devotion in various directions and installed within sacred objects. For the inner contents, they properly constructed man-height stūpas of victory, each containing foot-length golden statues of the Great Omniscient One and the Lord himself, with the relic pills as the main contents. These were abundantly filled with the Lord's relics, many relic pills, countless dhāraṇīs explained in the tantras, blessed objects of previous gurus and so forth. During the holy day of the first month of the Year of the Pig, about thirty teachers and disciples performed an excellent consecration. [The stūpas] remained radiating with auspiciousness and blessings.

During all the intermediate periods, rainbow lights and flower rains continuously fell from the sky. Especially on the main day of the consecration, a great shower of flowers fell upon the earth.

Some were suspended in the air without falling to earth, while others appeared the size of stars near the sun's rays and remained there for a long time - these and other inconceivable miraculous signs transcended the realm of ordinary minds. This caused the ocean of faith of disciples who followed him to expand completely.

Furthermore, although there were many precious and extraordinary qualities, such as receiving blessings from lamas and deities through direct and symbolic means, and the effortless accomplishment of all activities by ḍākinīs and dharma protectors, these were not proclaimed everywhere. How could one write about them when bound by sacred commitments? In brief, he was none other than the embodiment of all the Victorious Ones, the all-pervading lord Vajrasattva.

Through his display of being inseparable [from these qualities], through his inconceivable emanations, for as long as space exists, he undoubtedly manifested the supreme vajra state of bodhicitta that effortlessly and spontaneously accomplishes the benefit of beings.

Here it is said:
Embodiment of all the glorious Victorious Ones,
Extremely rare lord of the supreme vehicle's teachings in existence,
Lama who increases the virtuous aspirations of the Bodhisattvas,
I prostrate to your stainless lotus feet.

With a body inseparable from all the Buddhas,
Speech that proclaims the dharma sound of the great secret tantras,
Mind that opens a hundred doors of samādhi,
I take refuge in the feet of the supreme guide, the lama.

Skilled in the essential points of profound and clear non-dual view,
Having found the nectar of meditation on the union of bliss and emptiness,
Passing time in conduct that pleases the Victorious Ones—
O supreme spiritual guide, please bless me!

Even a single pore's offering to the guru
Is said to be far superior to worshipping all the Victors of the three times.
Since this is taught in the extensive scriptures, my mind
Has become devoted to worshipping the qualified guru.

Therefore, I offer to the incomparably kind lord guru
My body, life, wealth,
And whatever virtue exists from study, contemplation, and meditation.
Please accept these from the undefiled expanse!

Though your qualities are boundless, reaching the limits of space,
My mind, like a winged bird,
Having exhausted its strength flying in the sky of your liberation story,
Finds a brief rest in this small account.

Through the virtue of briefly explaining the deeds
Of the precious wish-fulfilling one, who is the actual Three Jewels,
The guru of beings in the three realms, lord of dharma,
May all beings attain the state of vajra-holder!

This Liberation Story of the Kind Root Guru, Supreme Guide, Dharma King, Called "The Sun Illuminating Wondrous Appearances" was composed because many faithful and devoted disciples repeatedly requested it both immediately and over time. Seeing it as a cause for the faculty of faith and devotion to greatly increase through remembering even just some aspects of the holy guru's qualities and the deeds of his body, speech and mind,

Through the great compassionate consideration of that venerable lord of the wheel [Kunga Sönam], I, the Buddhist monk [Śākya bhikṣu] Könchok Lhundrub, who was nurtured by his boundless kindness in the three vows, three tantras, and pith instructions through empowerments and so forth, took as the basis the biography composed by the great master Muchen. Having elaborated somewhat based on the record of teachings received and other sources, along with some commonly shareable biographical accounts that are trustworthy and free from exaggeration and denigration, I compiled this at the dharma court of glorious Ewam Chöden on the first auspicious day of the first month in the Earth-Male-Dog year called Namjang. May this become a cause for the wisdom vision of the glorious holy guru to enter the mindstreams of all sentient beings, headed by my parents. [iz-34-01. doc 396].
