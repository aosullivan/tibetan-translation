Chapter Three: A Definitive Discussion on the Context of Vidyadhara Vows

Homage to the Guru!
From the wisdom ocean of Vairocana's complete enjoyment,
Emanating as Samantabhadra in the ten directions,
Empowered by the victors as Vajra-holders,
I bow to the glorious lord of the proud ones.

After this expression of worship, the first question of the third chapter asks:
When receiving the four empowerments, does one obtain the three vows?
From the higher empowerments, does one obtain
The Mantra vow that is received,
The Pratimoksha that is obtained,
And the Bodhisattva vow that is accepted?

This has two parts: raising the questioner's intention and giving the actual answer. The first has two parts: the reason for asking and the fault of the teaching being wasted if not asked. 

As for the first, all commentators of this text have not made detailed presentations, explaining that receiving the complete four empowerments is generally the cause for obtaining the three vows, and particularly the Mantra vow. Specifically, it appears they explain that one becomes endowed with the three vows merely by receiving the four empowerments, even without previously having taken the lay practitioner's vows.

Second, when explained this way, doubts arise thinking: This contradicts the explanation from the River of Empowerment which states that the two vows - the Pratimoksha and Bodhisattva vows - generally depend on the empowerment ritual and specifically on the highest yoga empowerment, that the Mantra vows of the three lower tantras also depend on the four empowerment ceremony, that the highest yoga Mantra vow depends on the higher empowerments, and that all highest yoga commitments and vows are obtained at the conclusion of the vase empowerment.

The actual answer has two parts: eliminating others' analytical extremes and giving one's own answer. First, recent discussions say that when it's stated here that through empowerment one becomes endowed with the three vows, the Pratimoksha vow at that time is the Bodhisattva Pratimoksha vow, whose essence is the intention to abandon harming others along with its seeds. The temporal distinction is that it is taken until enlightenment, and the time of obtaining it is during the preliminary student preparations, from the verse of the seven-limb prayer or the words of taking the five family vows.

The Bodhisattva vow distinguished among the three is the vow of awakening mind. The time of obtaining it and the limit of taking it are as before. For the Mantra vow distinguished among the three, there are two ways of obtaining it: through mere verbal commitment and through empowerment. The first arises after making the three-fold commitment to the five family vows. The second fully arises after the vase empowerment is complete, by reciting three times "Just as the principal has commanded." As stated in the River of Empowerment: "Thus these comprise all the yoga commitments and vows." Therefore, they explain there are no Mantra vows to be taken or obtained beyond that.

This is incorrect for three reasons: the fault of not identifying the Pratimoksha vow explained in this treatise, the fault of consequently not identifying the Bodhisattva vow, and the fault of limiting the scope of the Mantra vow.

As for the first, when asserting this way, one accepts the very previous position that this treatise refutes, as it states: "If the Pratimoksha vow is taken until enlightenment, its ritual will certainly be destroyed and there is concern its essential points will be corrupted."

If it is said this refers to the Pratimoksha vow common to Shravakas,
Here is my English translation:

Regarding the pratimoksha vows, which are one of the three vows discussed in this text, they need to be explained right here. As it is said: "Therefore, such a ritual, held by the generation of bodhicitta intention, following the Śrāvaka tradition of the eight types of pratimoksha, becomes the Mahāyāna pratimoksha."

If your way of explanation is like that, you have not identified the main body of the bodhisattva vows. The principal among these vows is the engagement vow, and its main body is what is called the morality of restraining from misdeeds, also known as the bodhisattva pratimoksha. This primarily involves abandoning the three mental [misconduct] among the ten non-virtues along with their seeds. You have relegated this to the pratimoksha vows that are part of the three vows. Therefore, what remains is nothing other than the aspirational bodhicitta vow.

If you ask what is insufficient about just that, then according to this view, the bodhicitta taken through Cittamātra ritual would incorrectly lack vows, because the aspirational bodhicitta vow is not explained there, and the morality of restraining from misdeeds is included within the pratimoksha vows.

If you say there are the moralities of gathering virtuous dharmas and benefiting sentient beings, these do not constitute the complete bodhisattva vows, because even the great Venerable One did not establish root downfalls in relation to these.

Generally, your identification of the tantric vows is too narrow, because in your explanation, the vows obtained from the two lower tantras' empowerments are not included, and the vows obtained from the three higher empowerments are not explained.

Regarding this, some opponents who maintain their own position say: "In the two lower tantras, there are no tantric vows to be obtained other than the bodhisattva vows, because no ritual for taking them is explained."

This lacks valid reasoning because whatever empowerment ritual there is, that itself is the ritual for taking those vows. If you think there is no separate ritual for taking vows other than the engagement vow before empowerment, then both your premise is unestablished and your pervasion is uncertain.

By that same logic, even in the two higher tantras, there would be no vows to take for maintaining the fourteen root downfalls other than the five family vows, because according to you, there is no separate ritual for taking vows. This cannot be accepted because it would absurdly follow that those who possess the highest tantric vows would not need to maintain the fourteen root downfalls and others beyond what is explained as the five family commitments.

The position maintained by these regular opponents that all highest yoga tantra vows are definitely obtained either through taking the five family vows or through the vase empowerment is also too narrow. According to you, it would be sufficient to quote: "Seek a guru and receive the vase empowerment; through that one obtains the three vows."

Therefore, one must definitely accept the vows obtained through the three higher empowerments. As explained by the higher gurus, regarding the highest yoga tantra vows: there are three vows related to body, speech and mind; three vows related to the individual; and four vows related to empowerment. First, during the preparation of the disciple, the disciple's body, speech and mind are blessed as the three vajras, and there are vows to abandon the ten non-virtues. These are threefold through body, speech and mind. From the Sambhuta: "The bodies of women and men are shown to be produced by many karmas. One should not act even through ignorance - this is the earth vajra commitment. Taming various sentient beings and all..."
Through deluded thoughts and negative thinking
Do not denigrate the mind;
This is the samaya of vajra mind.
Do not speak harsh words and unpleasant speech
That causes discomfort to others' ears 
Through gossip and expressions of displeasure;
This is the samaya of vajra speech.

Regarding the division by persons, there are three types of vows: those of beginners, those who have attained mental stability, and those who have attained great stability.

Regarding the division by empowerments, there are four types of vows connected with the four empowerments:

The samayas of the vase empowerment are:
Abandoning the ten non-virtues
Not aspiring to the lesser vehicle
Not turning away from alcohol and the welfare of beings
Abandoning meditation on signs of deities and so forth
Abandoning root and branch downfalls
Protecting the five family vows without deterioration

The samayas of the secret empowerment are:
Partaking of the five nectars
Meditating on the three suchnesses of vajra, bell and mudra

The samayas of the wisdom-knowledge empowerment are:
Not abandoning bodhicitta
Relying on either actual or wisdom consorts day and night

The samayas of the fourth empowerment are:
Practicing the four intentionally taught samayas
Abandoning the five poisons
Meditating on suchness

As for what constitutes the essence of the vows obtained from the three higher empowerments, through what methods, at what time they arise, and how to protect them from deterioration - these are taught in the second chapter of the Later Tantra and extensively in other tantras, which will be explained below.

From the River of Empowerments: "Thus these encompass all samayas and vows." This refers to samayas connected with all four empowerments. In the previous section, the extensive explanation of samayas from the Vajra Tent Tantra mostly includes the samayas just explained that are connected with all four empowerments. Therefore, one should not doubt whether these vows connected with the higher empowerments are actual tantric vows, because the essence of tantric vows is a mind with its seeds that protects from transitory karmic imprints and conceptual characteristics, which is especially complete here.

As it is said: "Through the enumeration of four empowerments, the stages of joy and so forth should be known." Even the vase empowerment is taught as a method for drawing forth the wisdom of great bliss that protects the mind from conceptual characteristics.

The second response: "Through that one obtains the three vows" means that completing the four empowerments is taught as the cause for obtaining all three complete vows. However, merely that much is not sufficient as a cause for obtaining the first two vows. Having established as a basis what was already taught in the first two chapters as causes for obtaining the first two vows, when one receives the four empowerments on top of that, one obtains the complete tantric vows and thus becomes possessed of the three vows.

Then what are the three vows that are the main subject matter of this treatise? They are: the pratimoksha vows taken in accordance with the Shravakayana vinaya, the bodhisattva vows obtained in accordance with either of the two systems of Madhyamaka or Cittamatra, and the tantric vows taken through the ritual of highest secret mantra.

For establishing possession of the three vows, it is not necessary to obtain each vow completely. This is because one can be established as possessing the three vows merely through the lay practitioner's vows, just the aspiring bodhicitta vows, and just the vase empowerment of highest yoga tantra.

It is not maintained that those receiving just the vase empowerment of yoga tantra must hold tantric vows, because the masters repeatedly cited as scriptural authority this passage from the Vajra Peak: "Having well established in the three vows, the mandala should be shown to them."
Here is the master's response regarding whether one may or may not validly bestow the four complete initiations of certain forms of Vajravārāhī as explained in the scriptures:

This has two parts: First, the reason for asking is that the text's explicit teaching appears to refute both the existence of proper initiations for Vajravārāhī in general and the validity of blessing initiations.

Second, the fault of not asking would be: In that case, are there or are there not authentic rituals, initiations and maṇḍalas for Vajravārāhī that are not fabricated? If not, this would contradict the evident existence of: the ritual for the 13-deity Vārāhī maṇḍala composed by the Shambhala Kalkin Vishnu Gupta; the 37-deity Vārāhī sādhana by Master Kalyānākara Gupta; the Vajrayoginī initiation ritual by Lord Śhāvaripa; the manifest Vārāhī maṇḍala ritual by Śrī Umāpati; and the sādhana by Umāpati.

If such initiations do exist, are they suitable or unsuitable for ripening unripened disciples? If suitable, this contradicts the cited scriptural quote: "From Vajravārāhī herself, having received initiation and holding the samaya, one may bestow Vajravārāhī." If unsuitable as ripening initiations, then it would have been sufficient to say that although proper Vajravārāhī initiations exist, they are not suitable for ripening - so why make such effort to refute their very existence?

The actual response is: Setting aside examination of whether Vajrayoginī maṇḍalas with various numbers of deities and their rituals exist in general, and whether their rituals are currently practiced, this text's prior position refers to the followers of Lord Gampopa who perform merely the blessing of the five-deity Vajravārāhī from Marpa's Mother Tantra tradition as an entry point into secret mantra for those who have never practiced tantra before. 

The way this is refuted is: Although the term "dharma door" is not found in authoritative texts, if you assert this practice, it must be an initiation that ripens the unripened. But your blessing is not suitable for this because it lacks the preparatory and actual components, thus lacking all characteristics of ripening initiation. It cannot create one who holds the three vows, and it cannot be given to those who haven't previously received proper initiation.

Some combine this mere blessing ritual with a vow-giving ceremony and claim it creates a holder of the three vows. Others, realizing one cannot become a vow-holder just by taking vows without initiation, perform the four symbol initiations using a pig's head and claim this opens the door to secret mantra. This is mere fabrication - as there is no source for the four symbol initiations, even combining them with vow-taking ceremonies remains fabrication.

The third question asks: "Does your own tradition also reject blessing rituals, maṇḍalas and initiations for Vajravārāhī?"

The reason for asking is that when looking at the literal meaning of the text stating "For some Vajravārāhī..." through "Even taking vows with Vajravārāhī's blessing will not be established," it appears to say that for Vajravārāhī's blessing there are no vow-taking ceremonies or initiation rituals in general, and that even if performed, the vows would not be established.
Due to the reason of their existence. The fault of not asking is as follows: Then one might object that in our own tradition's blessing of Nāropa's Khecarī, the ritual of taking the five families' vows and the ritual of four empowerments that are explained would need to be abandoned.

Secondly, the actual response is: In our tradition's blessing of Vajrayoginī, the ritual of taking vows is not a means of obtaining what has not been obtained. This blessing is only to be given to one who has received and not damaged the commitments and vows of Cakrasaṃvara, not to others. Even so, performing the vow-taking ritual is not without purpose, because there is benefit in clearly reaffirming previously taken vows as a basis for receiving the blessing known as the four empowerments.

The fourth question is: If blessings are not accepted as a Dharma door, why are blessings definitely given before teaching certain completion stage practices?

This has two parts. First, the reason for asking: As it is said, "Moreover, regarding Vārāhī's blessing, performing it as a Dharma door of secret mantra is not explained in any tantra." Looking at the literal meaning, it appears contradictory that Vārāhī's blessing is a Dharma door of secret mantra.

Second, the fault of not asking: Regarding both the term and meaning of "Dharma door," while the term may not appear in tantras or Indian texts, its meaning must be accepted. Of the two - empowerment and blessing - just as empowerment is accepted as a Dharma door, blessing must also be accepted as such, because the reasoning applies equally.

For example, just as one needs to open the Dharma door with Guhyasamāja empowerment to teach the five stages of Guhyasamāja, and one needs to open the Dharma door with Cakrasaṃvara empowerment to practice the instructions of the five stages and four stages of Cakrasaṃvara, similarly for many instructions such as the completion stage of the central channel, utterly unelaborate, inconceivable, Mahāmudrā without letters, and guidance on White Cakrasaṃvara, each requires its respective blessing to precede it.

Therefore, if one does not establish blessings as a Dharma door because they require a qualified empowerment to precede them, then in the three higher empowerments and Kālacakra's division into worldly and transcendent empowerments, the four transcendent time empowerments and the body maṇḍala empowerments of Cakrasaṃvara Ghaṇṭapāda would not be Dharma doors for hearing their respective completion stages. The body maṇḍala empowerment of Hevajra would also not be a Dharma door for its two stages, because they maintain that an empowerment in the outer maṇḍala must precede these.

Second, the actual response: In general, since each profound completion stage has its own unique method of opening the Dharma door, the term "opening the Dharma door" must apply to both empowerment and blessing. Moreover, the initial Dharma door is empowerment alone, because without receiving it, one cannot engage in teaching or hearing profound secret mantra teachings, except for some special cases of kriyā tantra.

Therefore, the point of contention here is what is called the initial opening of the Dharma door, based on the position of the former party. Since this is equivalent to what the latter party knows as the empowerment that ripens the unripened, Vārāhī's blessing is not suitable for this because it cannot be performed for those whose Dharma door has not been opened by ripening empowerment. Particularly regarding Nāropa's Six Dharmas...
This special instruction is compiled from many Unsurpassed Yoga Tantras, and according to the Vinaya, one must receive full ordination through the ceremony of both father and mother yogas.

Therefore, regarding the ceremonies for people of earlier times, as it is said: "These were explained in the earlier ceremonies." As stated in this treatise: "These were the ceremonies of earlier times, not suitable for people of the present day," and "It is said that empowerments were bestowed in the emanated mandala - this was the ceremony of the noble ones of the past." Thus, the term "earlier ceremony" was used broadly.

The sixth question states: "In the General Tantra of Secrets, it mentions that in mandalas, empowerments are given to pairs of two, four, or more disciples."

Regarding this, there are two points. First, the reason for the question: As it is quoted, "When giving tantric empowerments, giving them to an unlimited number is forbidden by Vajradhara." Those who cite this source appear to say that empowerments should only be given to unpaired disciples numbering less than twenty-five, and that it is not proper to give empowerments to paired disciples.

Second, the fault of not asking: If this is so, then the General Tantra of Secrets states: "The guru should give empowerment to a single disciple in the mandala. The wise one should not give empowerment simultaneously to two disciples. Whether two, three, or four, the guru should give empowerments using separate new implements for each one." This raises doubt about whether it explains giving empowerments simultaneously to two or four disciples.

Another question arises here: "For empowerments of the Carya Tantras, if there is no fixed number of disciples, why is there a fixed count from one to ten? Doesn't the scripture of the General Tantra of Secrets indicate a fixed number of disciples for the acceptance ceremony at the time of accepting disciples?"

There are two reasons for this question. First, if explained this way, the Vairocana Abhisambodhi states: "Disciples who are faithful and of noble lineage, who have faith in the Three Jewels, possess wisdom regarding the profound, have great enthusiasm, possess moral discipline, have patience and are not miserly, are brave and have stable minds - whether ten, eight, seven, five, one, two, four, or more - should be accepted without examination." While it does not specify they must be unpaired up to ten, one might wonder why it doesn't mention more than ten. And if one thinks the count up to ten is just exemplary and the tantra's intention includes larger numbers, this certainty is not apparent, because immediately following the quoted passage it states: "O Lord of Secrets, those who previously practiced the limitless methods of the Mahayana secret mantra path are Vajrasattva, and this numerical limit was established for their sake."

The second reason for the question: While masters who perform empowerments explain that the intention of that passage from the General Tantra of Secrets is that there is no fixed number for disciples at the time of acceptance, but there is a fixed number for disciples in preparation, it appears the scripture does indicate a fixed number for accepting disciples, as it clearly uses acceptance terminology saying "accept unpaired disciples" and "cannot be fully accepted," and because those quoted passages were taught in the context of empowerment.
According to the Mūlatantra, qualified disciples should be accepted in odd numbers from one up to twenty-five. An even number or more than that should not be accepted into a single mandala. As stated in the General Tantra: "The wise should accept disciples - one, three, five, or seven, up to twenty-five. Beyond that number, disciples should not be fully accepted."

When accepting disciples and during the preparatory rituals, up to twenty-five disciples in odd numbers can be gathered together to complete the acceptance and preparation ceremonies. However, for the main empowerment ritual, it should be performed individually for each disciple. As stated in the General Tantra itself: "The wise one should properly accept disciples through this ritual. Summoning each disciple individually, perform the secret torma as before." And: "Having summoned one disciple at a time, making offerings according to the ritual, the knower of the ritual should perform the secret torma." Also: "The wise should never give empowerment to two disciples simultaneously."

While it is permissible for two or four disciples to sit in a row during the main empowerment, it is not appropriate to empower two or more disciples simultaneously using the same empowerment substances. For preparation ceremonies, all must gather together. If some are missing, substitutes should be arranged, or if that's not possible, effigies should be made for those absent, as stated in the General Tantra: "If accepted disciples are absent during preparation, make their effigies and perform the prescribed activities. If some accepted disciples cannot come due to circumstances, others should substitute for them."

This does not refer to disciples who definitely cannot attend the main empowerment. For such cases, there would be no purpose in using effigies or substitutes during preparation. If it were just about completing the numbers, substitutes wouldn't be needed when numbers like two, four, six, or eight are missing from the acceptance ceremony count.

The purpose of using substitutes during preparation is so they can receive the empowerment themselves when the time comes. Otherwise, if the substitute were to receive the empowerment, it would follow that the effigy should also receive empowerment, and one who hasn't been accepted would receive preparation and empowerment.

Regarding the second analysis: Although in Action Tantra empowerments there is no fixed requirement for odd or even numbers of disciples, they should not be unlimited, as more than ten is prohibited. However, there is no fixed number for accepted disciples.
The great compassionate master said
To hold immeasurable ones, it is thus stated.

In response, according to the Vairocana Abhisambodhi:
Although a specific number is given,
The great compassionate master declared
That one should vow to liberate all beings without exception.
To create the cause for bodhicitta,
One should accept limitless sentient beings.

Thus it is better to express the text this way:
For empowerment in the Carya tantras,
There is no fixed number of disciples to be accepted,
Except for specific exceptions mentioned.

According to the General Tantra and Abhisambodhi,
The difference between fixed and unfixed numbers of disciples
Appears to be between examining before accepting
And examining after accepting them.

For mere entrance into the mandala,
No examination is needed - unlimited numbers may be accepted.
As stated in the Tattvasamgraha:
"For entering this great mandala,
One need not examine who is or is not a proper vessel."

The third analytical response:
The Secret General Tantra states a fixed limit
Of twenty-five or fewer disciples,
Which is undoubtedly the intention of the river of empowerment.
Yet the practice of the gurus follows the Vairocana Abhisambodhi,
Either setting no fixed number due to the special purpose 
Of generating bodhicitta,
Or limiting it to twenty-five based on performing
One complete ritual of making and offering 
A powder mandala and receiving empowerment.

In brief, for both Kriya and Carya tantras,
It is established there are fixed numbers for empowerment disciples.
By that reasoning, fixed numbers also apply
For disciples of the two higher yoga empowerments,
As explained by many authentic masters like Daripa.
Though the Vajravali mandala ritual states
"Accept up to a thousand if they are worthy,"
Upon careful analysis this refers not to the time of acceptance
But rather fails to establish the number for empowerment.

As it is said:
"Even fools with courage
Cannot transgress vinaya rituals.
In all secret mantra rituals,
Fools act according to their whims.
For example, ordination
Cannot exceed three people,
But for tantric empowerment
They give it without fixed numbers -
This is forbidden by Vajradhara."

If explained differently,
Those who give empowerment without fixed numbers would argue:
"If by Kriya tantra reasoning
Higher tantra empowerment numbers are fixed,
Then by Carya tantra reasoning
Why aren't unlimited numbers established?
If it differs because it's a general tantra,
It's hard to be general for all."

If asked whether you can avoid
The fault shown in the last two lines:
"Though not general for all,
The fixed number of disciples
Is applied to others by many authentic ones.
If some show unlimited empowerment disciples
Except for acceptance, we'll accept that,
Made in terms of ancient rituals
For tens of millions of sages."

Also here it should be added:
"The limit of three for ordination
Refers not to lay and monastic assemblies
But to the requesting ceremony."

The seventh question: "When the sun rises for the deities..."
From there, if they need to depart...

Should offerings and departure requests be made during the period from the preparatory ceremony through the main ceremony? Also, should this be done during the days between the disciple's empowerment and the master's empowerment, even for feast offerings?

Regarding this, there are two points. First, the reason for asking is that when most commentators explain passages like "when the sun sets, the deities..." they indicate this refers to the wisdom deities who have been invited to reside in the mandala, as the basis for the deities assembling at sunset and needing to depart before sunrise. The fault of not asking would raise doubts: Would the preparatory deities raised in the sky need to depart during the drawing of the mandala? If it refers to deities residing in the completed mandala, would all powder mandalas be limited to less than one day's duration and empowerments not be possible during daytime?

Second, the actual response: Here "deities" does not refer to the wisdom deities invited into the empowerment mandala or the sky-mandala deities who bestow empowerment. If it did, even deities consecrated in painted mandalas and cast images would need to depart at sunrise. This would be too extreme for practices and offerings lasting many days, like Śrī Paramādya and Condensed Peak Tantra, or for empowerments taking many days up through empowering disciples as vajra masters.

Rather, in that sacred mandala space, the vajra master need not definitely invite them as part of the mandala ritual. Through the power of blessings, the hosts of vīras and yoginīs who definitely gather only at night are fit to be offered torma and other offerings in the subsequent rites. The Four Great Kings and the gods of the Thirty-Three and others who come only at night to Jambudvīpa should be addressed when they instantly appear at night to give and receive teachings.

As stated in the General Secret Tantra: "When the sun sets, the deities definitely gather through blessings in the beneficial mandala." And elsewhere: "Whatever secret mantra deities, worldly protectors, spirits devoted to the dharma, and beings delighting in the teachings...all should approach with the mandala."

The Dharma Proclamation Sūtra states: "Lords of gods, demigods and kiṃnaras, Indra and others who have accomplished the supreme dharma - Come here to listen to the holy dharma which is the cause of perfect peace and bliss, the Buddha's teaching."

The Vinaya states that teachings should be given on the eighth, fourteenth and fifteenth nights, instantly through the night. Therefore, if one begins the disciple empowerment ritual after sunset and completes it before sunrise, it will please the hosts of vīras and yoginīs who gather only at night. There is the special purpose of satisfying with dharma and benefiting the deities who have power over secret conduct and view.

Thus the ritual must definitely be completed before sunrise, for when the sun rises those deities naturally disperse - this is the way things are. If the ritual is not completed, it becomes an obstacle to the profound dharma and, due to incomplete intention, becomes inauspicious. Similarly, the meaning taught in the Vinaya is that dharma discussions should be held through the night...
The gods rejoice when there is dharma discourse, and abiding there they become clouds of virtue. When separated from dharma discourse, they transfer elsewhere. This is not necessarily regarding the profound secret mantra teachings.

The eighth question asks: "Without entering another mandala, through the vajra-ghanta master's empowerment ritual, does one obtain the samaya of secret mantra or not?"

Regarding this, there are two parts. First, the reason for asking: According to the commentators explaining the text starting with "From Vajravarahi herself..." when examining the implications, they indicate it is improper to give these blessings without first receiving empowerment in an external mandala, suggesting one cannot become holder of the three vows through Varahi's blessings alone.

The fault of not asking: Then even through empowerment based on the mandala ritual explained in Vajraghanta master's empowerment text, one could not properly become holder of the three vows, since without being empowered in an external Chakrasamvara mandala, this body mandala empowerment would be improper according to the practice tradition of the gurus. This position is untenable because here there is both the complete vow-taking ritual and full conferral of the four qualified empowerments. As stated: "Even when repeating the ripening empowerment..." up to "thereby becoming holder of three vows" - all explanations of obtaining tantric vows are complete. 

If you say such a person newly obtaining tantric vows they didn't have before must be of highest capacity, this contradicts the statement: "These days for all beings high and middling, empowerment should be given in powder mandalas, but other ripening methods are prohibited in the tantras."

Second, the actual answer: The body mandala empowerment ritual according to Vajraghanta master's system must be explained as a ripening empowerment ritual and method for becoming holder of three vows in relation to suitable disciples, as explained by that master himself and also interpreted that way by Lord Sonam Tsemo.

How so? As stated in the root text itself: "Empowerment with mandala as prerequisite was taught by Vajradhara. Now I'll explain the nature of that mandala. The sequence of painted activities and lines with colors is shown. This very migration is by nature the non-dual accomplished mandala. The nature of the two artificial ones is accepted based on disciples' capacity. The wise one's practice is not that, for seeing true meaning brings liberation."

The meaning is: In this master's system, of the two - ripening empowerment and liberating path - first is this body mandala empowerment. Second is teaching the five stages of the liberating path to disciples ripened by that empowerment. As stated in that text: "By showing the four empowerments, if empowering the committed one, it's for obtaining uncontrived dharma."

Now regarding in which mandala this empowerment is given: Dividing mandalas into three types, disciples suitable as vessels for this empowerment ritual are not to be empowered in the two artificial mandalas. Since these disciples are of wise nature, merely being empowered after seeing the naturally accomplished mandala brings liberation. This is explained in the verse "The nature of the two artificial ones..." etc. If before this empowerment
If any of the two types of empowerment is needed, there is no occasion for such statements. Nevertheless, nowadays Vajra Masters, finding it difficult to determine whether students are naturally wise and whether they have faith and wisdom to understand the naturally-established mandala, consider that for those seeking the Chakrasamvara empowerment, rather than initially giving empowerment through this ritual, it seems better to give empowerment in either of the two constructed forms and gradually guide them, thus reducing fluctuations. While masters appear to practice this way, according to the tradition of the great accomplished master Ghantapada, it is completely incorrect to say that without first receiving empowerment in the outer mandala according to the instructional tradition of Hevajra, one cannot receive empowerment in the body mandala.

The ninth question asks: "If empowerment without sand mandala is not appropriate nowadays, then what about giving Vajravarahi blessings after empowering in a painted Chakrasamvara mandala?"

Regarding this, there are two aspects. First, the reason for asking is that the text states "Empowerment other than sand mandala is prohibited in other tantras," and in its commentary, Kumāra states "Empowerment other than sand mandala is prohibited in the Abhidhānottara Tantra." Others include painted mandalas within sand mandalas in their explanation, while some say empowerments other than either sand or painted mandalas are prohibited in the tantras.

The fault in not asking is that generally empowerment in painted mandalas is not suitable for ripening, and specifically if it is prohibited in the Abhidhānottara, how does this accord with the statement "The nature of both constructed forms is accepted according to the disciple's capacity," which teaches that empowerment in painted mandalas is for ripening disciples of dull faculties, as explained in the Heruka Abhyudaya Tantra and by earlier masters?

Moreover, according to the River of Hevajra Empowerment: "There are two systems - one based on painted images and one using sand mandalas. In the painted image system, one spends the day comfortably meditating on the deity mandala. This system using painted mandalas, taught in the Chakrasamvara Abhidhāna, was taught by Masters Vajraghanta and Prajñākirti and others. Even today in India, most rituals use this system. Since earlier gurus sometimes practiced this system, it is extremely excellent."

Some label painted mandalas as "water-color mandalas" and say empowerment for ripening is not appropriate in anything other than either these or sand mandalas. If so, then ripening empowerments would not be appropriate even in mentally-created celestial palaces. This contradicts Mañjughoṣa Yaśas's teaching that he gave ripening empowerments to 4.5 billion sages in the Kālachakra palace, and future Kalki kings must also be explained as receiving empowerment there.

If one thinks these are just explanatory categories not for current practice, even today when holy gurus give empowerment according to the meaning of "Give blessings to one who has received empowerment and maintains samaya," they first give empowerment to students who have never received it before in a painted Chakrasamvara Luipa mandala. Then Nāro...
Here is your empowerment to the dakini realm. Yet it may become impure." Such doubts arise.

Second, the actual response: As stated, "Ripening empowerments other than mandala are prohibited." This can be explained in two ways. First, "other" does not refer to anything besides powder mandalas, as it is known from context that this applies to Vajrayogini blessings, emanated mandalas, samadhi, and torma empowerments. As stated in "Request to the Buddhas of the Ten Directions":

"Some foolish ones engage in false rituals like Vajrayogini blessings, samadhi empowerments, torma empowerments and so forth - what need to mention them? Even those claiming to be learned but lacking essence have faith in these. If such things were Dharma, what would non-Dharma be?"

Some explain that the proof that ripening empowerments other than powder mandalas are prohibited comes from Naropa's commentary on "The Original Buddha" which states: "These seven empowerments should be given in the mandala." Naropa stated: "These seven empowerments should not be given in mandalas other than powder mandalas, such as painted ones."

However, this is not a complete explanation. In Kalacakra terminology, there are two conventions: empowerment in powder mandalas for worldly attainments, and empowerment in the three supreme mandalas for transcendent attainments. The latter is primary and is explained as not requiring drawing powder mandalas.

As stated in the Great Commentary: "In ultimate truth there is no drawing of powder mandalas, as the Blessed One prohibited it." Similarly, the Original Buddha states: "The Blessed One taught: 'Do not draw vajra lines or apply colored powders. By the essence of mantra alone, enlightenment is difficult to attain.'"

"Here for attaining wisdom, the Blessed One taught the three supreme mandalas thus: The bhaga, mind and faculties of body, the mandalas of vajra body, speech and mind - these three. Not by other five-colored powders."

At that time, while there seems to be debate about whether the seven childlike empowerments must precede the transcendent ones, those explained as transcendent empowerments must definitely be accepted as ripening empowerments in that system, as they are the primary empowerments.

The second explanation is: When it says "Ripening empowerments other than mandala are prohibited," it means: "Although nowadays it is taught that all beings, superior and middling, should receive empowerment in powder mandalas, ripening empowerments in emanated mandalas and so forth are prohibited in the tantras." This accords with the previous context.

In brief, while there are specific explanations of empowerment in body mandalas, painted mandalas, celestial palaces and heap mandalas, in general the ripening empowerment for disciples must be given in powder mandalas, as all tantras teach this. As the Vinaya states: "When strict rituals exist, one should not rely on lenient ones." Similarly, when general practices are possible, it is inappropriate to rely on specific exceptions. And because ordinary vajra masters who cannot perceive disciples' mindstreams must rely on the gradual approach for those of lesser fortune.

Question ten...
From whether an empowerment other than a ripening empowerment can confer the three vows - if not, what is obtained from it? If so, would this not make it a ripening empowerment? Therefore I ask whether you accept or reject empowerments that are not ripening empowerments.

Regarding this, there are two points. First, the reason for asking is: if it is an empowerment that newly confers tantric vows to a recipient who did not previously have them, it seems this would necessarily be a ripening empowerment, as stated in the passage from "the ripening empowerment..." to "...possessing the three."

The fault of not asking would be: When an undefiled tantric practitioner who has attained the highest yoga tantra vows newly receives empowerment into a lower tantra, or similarly when one established in lower tantric vows receives higher empowerments, or when one established in father tantra vows newly receives mother tantra empowerments - is a new tantric vow obtained or not? If not, then when such a master later gives those respective tantric empowerments to students, it would absurdly follow that the students do not obtain those vows, since the master himself lacks those vows. If vows are obtained, then when a practitioner who has completely obtained and not defiled the Hevajra vows receives full empowerment in the Guhyasamaja sand mandala, it would absurdly follow that this is a ripening empowerment for the student, since it is an empowerment that newly confers previously non-existent tantric vows. Many such doubts would arise.

Second, the actual response: In general there are two types of empowerment: empowerments needed for one's own yoga practice and empowerments for guiding others. The first has three types: ripening empowerments that ripen the unripened, empowerments that further develop what is already ripened, and empowerments that repair what was ripened but became damaged. 

The first has three types: general empowerments ripening those unripened by secret mantra, specific empowerments ripening those unripened in particular tantric systems' rituals, and empowerments ripening those unripened in individual branches within one tantric system. The first is like initially receiving empowerment when one has never before entered the path of mantra in this life. The second is like receiving higher empowerments after being ripened by lower empowerments. The third is like receiving mother tantra empowerments after being ripened by father tantra empowerments.

The second type is like receiving whatever empowerment was obtained at the time again from another master during the path, or through self-initiation. The third is like receiving empowerment from a master or through self-entry into a mandala to restore after incurring a root downfall.

The second main type includes receiving lower empowerments while established in higher vows, or receiving many empowerments without distinction of profundity.

Therefore, the terms "ripening empowerment" and "empowerment that ripens the unripened" are general terms applied to specifics. Since the term "ripening empowerment" was initially arbitrarily applied to the empowerment ritual in the sand mandala of Hevajra for someone who had never before entered the gate of highest yoga tantra in that life, while the etymology of "ripening empowerment" applies to most empowerments, its application is limited to just that one case explained above.

The eleventh question is: If the four empowerments and two stages are not suitable for the three lower tantric classes, what is meant by explaining they are suitable while sealing the higher tantras?
Without the four empowerments and the two stages, if they existed, these too would become Mahāyoga. For this reason, one might ask: "Then there appears to be a fault. As it is said, 'Following the Yoga Tantra tradition, the self-generation sādhana exists and is practiced according to that system.' The meaning of this is that all three lower classes of tantra are interpreted like Anuttarayoga Tantra, as the earlier masters accepted this terminology."

The direct answer to this is that in the independent system of the three lower tantras, there are no four empowerments and two stages.

The twelfth question arises from the previous discussion of karma: "After entering the Vajrayāna path, one must strive for both ripening and liberation. If you accept the two stages of ripening and liberation, how does one accomplish buddhahood in the independent system of the lower tantras? Do you accept the two stages there as well?"

The reason for this question is the previous answer itself. The fault would be that it would follow that the two stages of ripening and liberation are accepted in the independent system of the two lower tantras, because there exists a method for accomplishing buddhahood according to their own Vajrayāna system. This connection is understood from the context of "entering the Vajrayāna path" and so forth.

The direct answer is that although the three [lower tantras] independently lack empowerments and the two stages, their methods for accomplishing buddhahood are as they appear in their respective texts, such as obtaining siddhis in the manner of master and servant or in the manner of friends, according to their respective texts.

The thirteenth question: "If it is sufficient to practice according to one's respective texts, what is meant by the statement that 'Without empowerments and the two stages, it is not the teaching of Vajrayāna'?"

The reason for this question is the previous answer itself. The fault of not asking would be that this contradicts that very scripture and others, such as: "If you wish to meditate on secret mantra, receive the four unmistaken empowerments and meditate on the two unmistaken stages," and "Know this to be the supreme secret words of all tantra classes."

Regarding the answer to this, some commentators on this treatise have said that although the three lower tantras independently lack the four empowerments, they do have the two stages. This contradicts authoritative texts and should not be accepted.

The direct answer is that "Without empowerments and the two stages, it is not the teaching of Vajrayāna" is not a universal statement. Rather, it is spoken to the many practitioners who wish to meditate on the path of means relying merely on the four symbols without receiving empowerment. This is not only established by valid cognition but is also accepted, because even they themselves do not accept [such practitioners] as secret mantra practitioners of the three lower tantras.

The repeated statements that if one wishes to accomplish buddhahood through mantra, one needs to practice the four empowerments and two stages does not indicate that these exist in the independent system of the lower tantras. Rather, it means that if one wishes to accomplish buddhahood through mantra, it is supreme to practice according to the system of Highest Yoga Tantra, because from that comes the unsurpassed method for accomplishing buddhahood according to the mantra system.

The thirteenth question: "Even without receiving empowerment and generating bodhicitta, if it is suitable to accomplish [deities] like Amoghapaśa and others, what is the intended meaning of the statement in the answers to Do-kor-pa that one must train in Amoghapaśa and others after generating bodhicitta?" The reason for this question is that what appears in this text and what appears in those answers are somewhat discordant.
Due to causes and conditions of not being asked: Those who claim to explain this treatise accept only the question-answer texts and minor works composed by this venerable one as primary, without examining the authentic scriptures and treatises. They merely assert "it exists in the question-answer texts." While it's fine to accept what accords with authoritative texts, faults arise from not examining incorrect writings and added connecting phrases. This is just an example; much more needs to be understood.

The actual response: What emerges from this text itself is pure. Generally, among the three families of Action Tantra, while some practices of the Padma family can be done even without having generated bodhicitta, and some enlightened activities of the Vajra family can be undertaken after obtaining initiation and generating aspirational bodhicitta, the mantras and practices of the Tathagata family cannot be done without initiation, as is clear from their respective texts. Alternatively, this accords with the intention of the question-answer texts regarding aspirational mind and the phrase "even without having generated bodhicitta" referring to engaged [bodhicitta], and because it's understood from the context of the phrase "after obtaining engaged bodhicitta" in this text.

The fourteenth question asks: "Are the great meditators of the three lower tantras - Kriya, Charya and Yoga - considered Paramita great meditators?"

The reason for asking this is that there appears to be a contradiction between two statements: "Though a great meditator who doesn't practice the two stages is excellent, they do not transcend Paramita meditation" and "In Kriya, Charya and Yoga tantras, there are no four empowerments and two stages."

The fault of not asking is: As it is said: "Thus in the four classes of tantra, there are four different divisions regarding empowerments and paths. If one follows each one's proper ritual, the stated accomplishments will arise." Therefore, one might doubt whether great meditators practicing according to the explanations in the three lower tantra classes necessarily remain Paramita meditators, since they are meditators who don't practice the two stages.

The actual response: The statement "Though a great meditator who doesn't practice the two stages..." does not indicate universal coverage but rather takes as its basis those who claim to be great meditators according to previous positions. Among such meditators, there are two types: One claims to meditate on Mahamudra without having entered the mantra path at all, while the other practices the Six Dharmas of Naropa based merely on blessings without having received empowerment. These two types of meditators claim that when circumambulating great holy places like Tsari and Mount Kailash, their channel knots become untied and special realizations arise in their mindstream.

Such meditators are necessarily Paramita meditators because while they are meditators of this tradition, they are not mantra-system meditators. The latter reason is accepted because: They cannot be meditators of the lower tantras since they claim to meditate on Mahamudra, and they cannot be highest yoga tantra meditators since they practice the path of methods without having received empowerment, or even if received, they don't practice the two stages. If accepted, their explanation about channel knots becoming untied during pilgrimage to great sites is refuted since this is not explained in the Paramita vehicle.

The fourteenth question asks: If it's accepted that enlightenment through the Paramita vehicle depends on the quick path of the Vajrayana vehicle, what is meant by statements in this text like "If one wishes to accomplish this, without the methods like tummo, there is no term 'Mahamudra'"? If it doesn't depend, then Praise to Nairatmya...
Here is my translation:

"What is said in the commentary about this? [This section] has two parts: the intent of the question and the actual answer.

First, regarding the intent of the question, which has two parts: The reason for asking is as follows - as it is said: 'The great path of the perfect Buddha, the dharma free from all debate, is respectfully relied upon by the wise. If one wishes to accomplish this, without Vajrayogini's blessings, one does not meditate here on sahaja and so forth, lacking the method path of tummo and such, without even the terminology of Mahamudra' up until 'attaining perfect Buddhahood.' It appears to teach that perfect Buddhahood can be attained through the Paramitayana path alone.

The fault of not asking would be: Then, without relying on the swift path of tantra, can Buddhahood be attained through the Paramitayana path alone or not? If not, it contradicts the explicit teaching of this treatise. If it can be attained, it contradicts what was taught in the commentary on the Praise to Bdag med ma composed by the venerable one himself, which states: 'When there are differences in causes, there should be differences in results, like kotapa and rice,' and using the examples of myrobalan soaked in milk versus water, explains there are qualitative differences between the two types of Buddhahood attained through the two Mahayana approaches.

The actual answer has two parts: our own answer and the well-known answer of others. First, what is explicitly taught in this treatise was explained from the perspective of those abiding in the Paramitayana system, because in that system it is impossible to have obscurations that cannot be eliminated by the final wisdom of the tenth bhumi.

What was taught in the commentary on the Praise to Bdag med ma was spoken from the perspective of the great approach, because in that system there exist obscurations that cannot be eliminated by the final wisdom of the tenth bhumi. What are these? The habitual tendencies of transference. What is their antidote? The wisdom of great bliss. What is the cause for attaining this? It is precisely what is well-known as the proximate cause of mantra.

How this arises: Based on having well-trained in the meditation objects of the vase empowerment's generation stage, having perfected the self-blessing meditation objects of the secret empowerment, one gradually familiarizes oneself with the three aspects to be experienced in the third empowerment - the karmamudrā, jñānamudrā, and mahāmudrā. Through the stages of the illustrative examples and what they illustrate, this draws forth the wisdom of great bliss.

Through that wisdom, immediately after the end of the tenth bhumi known in the Paramitayana, having completely destroyed what the tantric vehicle's texts explain as the unique obscuration called 'habitual tendencies of transference,' one manifests the complete enjoyment body possessing the seven branches. This level is called the thirteenth vajradhara bhumi.

Second, others say: The buddha level explained in the Paramitayana is the eleventh all-luminous bhumi, which can be attained through the Paramitayana path alone without relying on the swift path of tantra. Though this is designated as Buddhahood, it is not actual Buddhahood because it has not attained the inconceivable state. Therefore, actual Buddhahood is that which abides on the thirteenth bhumi. This definitely depends on the swift path of tantra, as stated in the Samputa: 'Those who have not attained the inconceivable state are thus-gone ones. The basis being indicated is the authentic Vajrasattva.'

The fifteenth question is: 'If you assert the thirteenth bhumi depends on tantra but not on the eleventh all-luminous bhumi, in which tantric text is the eleventh all-luminous bhumi taught?'"
The answer is this: It is just what is known to others. As for the fault of not being asked: These days, those who hold the mantra vehicle think that while the Paramitayana places [enlightenment] at the eleventh bhumi of Universal Light, when traversing the path according to the mantra vehicle, after completing the path of training, on top of that they add two and a half more levels under the power of the path of training, and then place the remaining half at the level of buddhahood. They think this is the intention of the tantras and Indian texts.

This is not reasonable, because there is no proof and there are contradictions. First, when Tibetan commentators of the Guhyagarbha say "The eleventh bhumi of Universal Light, the twelfth bhumi of Stainless Lotus, the thirteenth bhumi of Vajradhara" - this is not valid as a source here, and if there were other valid scriptural sources they should be shown. In Chakrasamvara, the name of the eleventh bhumi is called "Unequaled," and this is also explained in the commentary on the Praise to Nairatmya. Although in other tantras when explaining twelve, sixteen, or twenty-plus bhumis, the name "Universal Light" appears, this was never explained as taking the eleventh bhumi from the vehicle of characteristics and adding Vajradhara as a thirteenth bhumi.

Second, the buddha dwelling on the bhumi of Universal Light as explained in the Paramitayana, who has abandoned all that is to be abandoned and attained all that is to be attained, would need to be explained as having interpretive meaning rather than literal meaning. In that case, it would need to be explained in terms of the basis of interpretation, purpose, and direct contradiction - but this is also not reasonable because no one has explained valid cognition that directly contradicts it.

If there were [such contradiction], then what is the referent of the buddha that the Paramitayana asserts dwells on the eleventh bhumi? If you say it is the Teacher, the Mighty Sage [Buddha Shakyamuni], then let the holders of the mantra vehicle prove that he is not a complete buddha! If you say that although the Paramitayana asserts Shakyamuni dwells on the eleventh bhumi, he does not dwell there because he dwells on the thirteenth bhumi - while it would generally be reasonable to say that, it proves our position and creates an internal contradiction for you. For if we argue: Consider that bhumi which the Paramitayana asserts to be the eleventh - it follows it is not the eleventh bhumi according to the system of the Great Method [Vajrayana], because it is the thirteenth bhumi in that system - you cannot reverse this with any reply.

Therefore this is how it should be explained: There is no qualitative difference between the ultimate fruition to be attained in the two methods. Whatever abandonments and realizations were attained by the Teacher, the Mighty Sage, both [vehicles] accept as the ultimate fruition to be attained, and neither asserts anything higher or lower than that. As stated in the Lamp of the Three Methods: "Although the meaning is one..." And from the Glorious Union: "What buddhahood is attained through countless millions of eons, through the supreme bliss you will accomplish in this very life, or else Vajradhara itself."

Nevertheless, the complete path that accomplishes the level of Vajradhara does not exist in the Paramitayana because according to Union, one has not attained the inconceivable state, and according to Kalacakra, one has not attained vajra yoga. In brief, according to the intention of the Samputa, although the ultimate attainment of both methods is one, the different ways of designating names from the perspective of elimination are: one is called "Buddha" and the other "Vajradhara."

The difference between these two is from the perspective of eliminating the cognitive obscurations and eliminating the latent tendencies of transformation. Now, without abandoning the latter, the former...
If there is elimination [of obscurations], [some say] while there is the capacity for elimination, actual elimination is impossible. Although one can remain in equipoise in the nature of that elimination at all times, one cannot manifest as the complete enjoyment body with its seven branches. For example, in the Pāramitā system, after attaining acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena, while one can manifest the dharmakāya within seven days, one cannot manifest the form body in that time because the collection of merit is not complete. Similarly, as long as the collection of merit is not fully perfected, the latent tendencies of cognitive obscurations cannot be completely eliminated.

The sixteenth question asks: Where in the scriptures is it explained about conquering Māra at the end of the tenth ground? While commentators typically explain about subduing the divine son Māra at dusk under the bodhi tree, and some also explain about overcoming the māra of afflictions at dawn with the vajra of wisdom, this explanation does not align with the system of the ten grounds and three kāyas. This is the system of the Śrāvaka schools, not the Mahāyāna, because they explain that one who became enlightened countless eons ago displays the manner of awakening under the bodhi tree. The māra to be tamed at the end of the tenth ground is explained by all commentators as the four māras, but this is completely unsuitable.

The actual response is that "māra" is a designation for the latent habitual tendencies. As Avalokiteśvara states in the Great Stainless Light Commentary: "Māra refers to the habitual tendencies and stains of beings' saṃsāric minds. Buddhahood refers to mind free from saṃsāric habitual tendencies. Therefore, māra is mind with stains, while buddhahood is stainless mind. The Buddha's conquest of external māra is like a dream - it is a manifestation of beings' own minds."

The seventeenth question asks: If there is no virtue arising from the vows of non-Buddhist traditions, why do Abhidharma texts explain meditative discipline among non-Buddhists? The commentator Kumāra explains there are no vows without taking refuge. The scholars of Samyé and Pökhang explain there is no virtue from non-Buddhist vows since they lack the vow of renunciation. Gadongpa explains that without tantric vows, even if they practice virtue it is neutral, not virtue arising from tantric vows. These explanations are problematic: First, meditative discipline is possible without taking refuge. Second, if there were no overlap between non-Buddhists and those with prātimokṣa vows, we could not identify the "converted non-Buddhist" mentioned in the Vinaya, nor explain the four-month probationary period for non-Buddhist lay vow-holders. Generally, non-Buddhist views are not an obstacle to generating prātimokṣa vows. The third position is too extreme since one can have the other two types of vows without tantric vows. While such analysis might seem to make textual explanation impossible, one should not worry - though commentators may give superficial explanations based on clear scriptural passages that quickly generate understanding in the foolish, it appears many scholarly treatises have been wasted. Therefore, consistency with the collections...
In response to the prior position that asks "What fault is there if one abandons misdeeds and performs virtue, even if they are a tirthika?" the answer is this: Those who do not accept any of the four seals of dharma are called outer tirthikas. There is indeed a difference between the virtue created by them and virtue created by Buddhist practitioners. Whatever virtue they create cannot exceed merit-concordant virtue, while the virtue of the latter becomes liberation-concordant virtue.

The meaning is that tirthikas who do not accept any of the four seals lack refuge vows. Therefore, they cannot generate liberation-concordant virtue. Generally, it's not that those with vows never generate intermediate virtue - lay practitioners can generate intermediate renunciant virtue. Regarding the need to examine whether tirthikas have entered and are pleased [with the dharma], although their view may be that of tirthikas, if their conduct involves taking refuge in the dharma and they hold pratimoksha vows, there is no fault since they accept that nirvana is peace from among the four seals of dharma.

The eighteenth question asks: "If there is no continuous virtue without vows, what about the ceremony of generating bodhicitta?" The reason for this question comes from the statement: "There is no preceptor without ordination, no guru without empowerment, no continuous virtue without vows." The fault of not asking would be thinking: Full ordination without prior renunciation would lack a preceptor; or thinking: Even if taught tantra and instructions without empowerment, wouldn't one become a guru; or doubting based on the bodhicitta ceremony in the author's own treatise which states: "There is no contradiction to continuous merit arising even without being bound by vows, as it is explained that continuous merit arises from merely offering flowers while focusing on the Buddha."

The actual answer is: This refers to those who are not renunciants or fully ordained; in general, those who have never received empowerment have no guru; and those with refuge vows lack continuous liberation-concordant virtue. Here, the measure of generating refuge is from taking refuge in the Dharma jewel, as it is the actual refuge. The measure of taking refuge is generating an aspiring mind toward that dharma, as the Sutralamkara states "This is the commitment of wanting that very thing," which indicates the measure of taking refuge.

The nature of that Dharma jewel refers to nirvana of any of the three vehicles, as stated: "Supreme among those free from attachment." Thus, after taking refuge in the dharma, if one dedicates whatever virtue one creates for that purpose, it becomes liberation-concordant virtue and arises continuously, because being virtue dedicated to the cause of enlightenment, it cannot be interrupted by anger, wrong views and so forth. With this meaning in mind, it is taught that continuous liberation-concordant virtue roots do not arise in those not bound by even mere refuge vows.

Then regarding how to explain virtue like offering flowers while focusing on the Buddha not being liberation-concordant virtue - there are two cases: If focusing on the causal refuge, one may obtain mere merit-concordant virtue. If focusing on the resultant refuge, it should be established as solely liberation-concordant virtue, for the very reason explained above. Therefore, at the outset of any virtuous practice, one should think "I will achieve whichever of the three enlightenments, for that purpose."
When one's aspiration is established, one's vows are definitely established, and virtuous actions concordant with liberation are continuously accomplished. Therefore, this virtue leads to the four results: dominant result, concordant result, ripened result, and disconnected result.

As stated here: "Through examining these essential points of Dharma, one understands much meaning through just this Dharma. What use are many unexamined scriptures?"

The nineteenth question asks: "Does one obtain tantric vows from the empowerments of the lower tantras? If so, how does this relate to the statement that four empowerments are necessary for obtaining tantric vows? While the samaya of completion stage is obtained through meditation, it is not taught to be obtained through empowerment ritual. If it is maintained that there are no tantric vows in the lower tantras, what is meant by the statement 'Without connecting empowerment with vows, even if excellent, it is just paramita'?"

This has two parts: raising the question's intent and giving the actual answer. The first has two parts: the reason for asking and the fault of not asking. 

First, those previous venerable ones did not clearly explain the system of which vows are obtained from empowerments of the three lower tantras, what root downfalls depend on those, and what vows are to be held besides the bodhisattva vows. Moreover, this treatise explains the way of holding mantra and the stages of attainment only according to what is taught in the highest yoga tantra texts, nothing more.

Second, do you accept or not that tantric vows are obtained from empowerments of the three lower tantras? If not, then there would be no special methods superior to the paramitayana, since there would be neither vows to hold nor vows to obtain that are not explained there. If you accept this, it contradicts the explanation that having the three vows depends on receiving all four empowerments.

[Translation continues in next section...]
Here is the taking of samaya and vows: Having generated bodhicitta, prostrate to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. After cleansing, hold flowers in the right hand and enter with face covered. With palms joined holding flowers, enter one, two, three, four or five times while taking these vows:

"All Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, please heed me. I, named such-and-such, offer myself to all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Please fully accept me at all times. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, please bless me. Great compassionate ones who completely protect all realms of beings, please grant me refuge. Please bestow upon me the great samaya to accomplish all activities." 

Recite this three times. Then recite once:
"Like limitless space, sovereign victor
I request the samaya of all lords and their sons without exception
The deathless, harmless, unimpeded beings
Through utmost stability, this is what is to be done."

Then scatter flowers. It is said that wherever the flowers fall, that is one's deity.

From the Root Realization of Manjushri: Then the mandala master, in accepting disciples, should place disciples who have complete faculties, maintain vows, have generated bodhicitta, and maintain cleanliness outside the mandala, not too far away, from one to eight disciples.

After accepting them as disciples, the mandala master should confer initiations from one to five to those who have generated bodhicitta, performed purification, and offered their bodies to all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. The remainder should be abandoned.

These words of taking vows teach two stages: the bodhisattva vow and the self-offering vow. The self-offering vow is not subsumed within the bodhisattva vow, because the later vow is taught in the Vairocana Abhisambodhi root text and commentary under the name "unobscured wisdom vow of the three times." This appears to have the same meaning as the vow stated as "I will generate bodhicitta in all yoga," as will be explained.

From the Vairocana Abhisambodhi: "All Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, please heed me. I, named such-and-such, from this time until reaching the essence of enlightenment, free from all things, having abandoned aggregates, elements, sense fields, grasped and grasper, through the equality of the selflessness of phenomena, with mind naturally empty and unborn from the beginning - just as the Blessed Buddhas and those Bodhisattvas generated bodhicitta, so do I generate bodhicitta."

Before this, the previously cited ritual for taking the self-offering vow was taught. The connection between these two is that self-offering means giving up body, speech and mind. Having given these up, all conceptual thoughts based on grasping subject and object are abandoned. Then one recognizes the non-dual wisdom called "mind vajra" and the ritual for taking that vow was just cited. This is given the name "unobscured wisdom vow of the three times." In the Abhisambodhi tantra, the Blessed One...
In the past, present, and future, please explain the unobscured wisdom vows in which bodhisattvas dwell that please the buddhas and bodhisattvas.

In its commentary, Buddha Guhya states: The unobscured wisdom of the three times is omniscient wisdom. This omniscient wisdom, being characterized by abandonment of both afflictive and cognitive obscurations, does not obscure and sees without impediment the reality of all things throughout past, present and future times. Therefore it is called the unobscured wisdom of the three times. To attain this wisdom, the vows of abandoning the ten non-virtues are called the vows of unobscured wisdom of the three times.

Thus, in both Kriya and Charya tantras, the unique vows to be held that are not common with the Paramitayana are called the vows of unobscured wisdom of the three times. As for how to hold these, in Kriyatantra one holds the vows through the method of entering into those commitments, while in Charyatantra one holds the vows through the method of abiding in those commitments. In Kriyatantra, it is merely abandoning the three imputed entities, without holding vows of resting evenly in the three ultimate entities. In Charyatantra, as explained in the earlier citations, both entry vows and abiding vows are combined and taken in sequence through application and actual practice.

Here, the synonyms for this wisdom to be held are: ultimate bodhicitta vajra, great bliss wisdom, and unobscured wisdom of the three times. Although there are differences in profundity between the four classes of tantra regarding the methods for actualizing this, they are merely methods of actualization - there is no difference in the wisdom to be actualized. As when asked "Who are you and what do you delight in?" the response is "The fortunate one delights in great bliss." This great bliss wisdom at that time must be explained as this very wisdom. And since the meaning of generating the mind of all yoga must also be explained as this, and since this question and answer is extensively explained in authentic mandalas of Kriya and Charya, therefore later Tibetans who say there are no tantric vows to be held or attained in Kriya and Charya other than conventional bodhisattva vows should be understood as unexamined. If that were so, it would be reasonable that root downfalls dependent on that would only be explained as those taught in bodhisattva texts, but many others are clearly taught in Kriya and Charya tantras.

Third, explaining the ritual for holding Yoga tantra vows, the Vajraśekhara Tantra states thus: First establish how to hold vows through questions and answers. Then proclaim the vows to be held. After that, the method for holding what was proclaimed. First: "How should one take the vows to accomplish the knowledge tantra? How should one keep the commitments? What constitutes damaged commitments? Having generated bodhicitta for the benefit of all beings, do not desire other vehicles. Then properly begin yoga. Wherever one dwells in the mandala, go before the master, bow at his feet and say: 'Great joy, you who are my teacher, please consider me. I request the way of great enlightenment from you, great protector. Please bestow those commitments. Please grant me the vows. Supreme one, please grant me the vows.' The master should examine in all ways..."
The samaya should be explained to anyone who is a suitable vessel and should be introduced. Whether they are children or students, give it to those who are worthy vessels. If they are known to be suitable vessels, give them everything including life and possessions. Having properly introduced them to the mandala according to the ritual, then with flowers and joined palms, with great joy and prostrations, confession and supplication should be made. Rejoicing should be done completely. With offerings, dedication should be made. Prostrations should be made in all directions and the great vows should be taken.

To the master who has authority, arising from the divine play of the Buddha, endowed with the irreversible wheel, enter into the great secret in the supreme city of great liberation. In all the exalted secret families, may the great master initiate me. Grant me, the fortunate one, the irreversible empowerment. Sealed with all the major and minor marks, perfectly beautiful buddha-form, may the great master grant me. The amazing great empowerment, for the benefit of all beings, may I always be a master. May the great master grant me. From the secret family, together with the vajra family is the wheel with its gates, perfectly complete - know this to be becoming a master.

Being personally pacified, having fully grasped bodhicitta, I enter with vows into the secret wheel. Then the master should speak these words: "Do you desire to be a great being who purely holds the great secret families?" One should reply "I request this."

Second, then the master should speak these words: "Take refuge in the Three Jewels - Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. This is the firm samaya of the pure Buddha family. Hold the vajra, bell and mudra with great intelligence. Bodhicitta is the vajra, wisdom is explained as the bell. The master too should be held, equal to all the buddhas. This is taught as the samaya and vow of the pure vajra family. To the supreme precious family, three times day and night, always give the four gifts of material things, fearlessness, dharma and love. Hold the outer, inner, secret and three vehicle samayas. This is taught as the samaya and vow of the pure lotus family.

To the supreme karma family, hold all vows perfectly and perform offerings as much as possible. The other fourteen are explained as root downfalls. Not to be abandoned or discarded, these are explained as root violations. Recite three times day and night, daily. When a yogi degenerates, it becomes a serious misdeed. You should not kill living beings, not take what is not given, not engage in sexual misconduct, and not speak falsely. Completely abandon alcohol, the root of all corruption. Except for taming beings, abandon all improper actions. Rely on the holy ones and serve the yogis. Guard as much as possible the three actions of body, four of speech, and four of mind. Do not desire the lesser vehicle, do not turn away from benefiting beings, do not abandon samsara, and do not be attached to nirvana. Do not disparage devas, asuras and secret ones. Do not trample on mudras, mounts, weapons and signs. These are explained as samayas - you should always protect them. The concordant vows are extensively explained in the secret tantras. Those too should be explained. Third, listen here to me, the master.
Just as the lord has commanded, so shall I act. As all the protectors of the three times [have done], through to "establish beings in nirvana." And furthermore, from that same text: "While abiding in the householder's vows, at that time accomplish the Vidyaraja. If one becomes fully ordained, properly abide in the three vows - Pratimoksha, Bodhisattva, and Vidyadhara is supreme."

And: "For one who does not take vows, is difficult to tame and lacks faith, merely establish them initially, but do not give them the activities. To one who has faith in the Three Jewels, fears negative actions and is well-restrained, has perfect faith and devotion - to them give the samaya. What are these samaya? The Buddha, Dharma and Sangha should be taken as principal."

"Never abandon bodhicitta even at the cost of one's life. Do not disparage the deities. Never [misuse] mantras and mudras. Do not disrespect the vajra master. The guru is equal to all buddhas. Do not carelessly trample on mounts, weapons, implements, or even the shadows of inferior beings. Never eat them. Do not tell others what one has previously seen. Never abandon the mantras and mudras one has learned. Do not kill beings or delight in other vehicles. Never become discouraged with beings' welfare or samsara. Never abandon practicing the six paramitas. Always abandon improper actions - these are your samaya vows."

Second, regarding the time of receiving what has been taken, there are two parts: the time of receiving and explaining the distinctions of the three vows that are received. For the first, there is our own system and refuting others' extreme views. First, when the vows specific to each of the three lower tantras are completely received, as the final support for completing the empowerment of becoming a guru relative to each, after extensively proclaiming the necessary samayas for the guru, they are received after repeating the condensed version three times. At that time one becomes suitable as a basis for generating the respective root downfalls, but not before.

Second, others say: "Receiving vows does not depend on empowerment. If they are not generated just by reciting the vow-taking ritual three times, there would be no purpose in reciting it three times." This is incorrect because: One who has taken vows but not received empowerment is not suitable as a basis for generating their respective root downfalls; Even for Kriya Tantra root downfalls, the Manjushri Root Tantra explains five root downfalls including "rejecting empowerment" and "harboring ill-will toward the guru" which cannot occur without empowerment; It contradicts the explanation that in Yoga Tantra one must hold the three samayas at the time of vajra master empowerment even though the respective vows were supposedly obtained just by reciting "vajra, bell, mudra" three times; It contradicts the supplication for guru empowerment explained by many authentic masters: "Grant the unsurpassed vows and samayas of all buddhas"; If vows were completely received at the end of taking them, the placing under oath during mandala entry would be pointless; Though one might think it's like reciting the trainings after receiving novice vows, it's different because that is merely for knowing the trainings, while here one is made to take them through proclamation of oaths.

Furthermore, according to your view, for the two higher yogas...
When taking vows there is no difference, since both vows are equally obtained through a single undifferentiated ritual procedure. If accepted, it would follow that there would be no difference in the precepts, teachings, consumption rules, and inseparable samaya commitments related to those vows. Therefore, without receiving empowerment, one has neither the meaning nor designation of mantra, and without these, mantra vows cannot exist. As stated in this text: "Without connection to empowerments, there are no mantra vows," and "The vidyadhara's mantra vows cannot be obtained without empowerment" - this is logical.

Thus, the initial arising of vows begins from the moment the three vajras bless the disciple's body, speech, and mind. The completion of their arising is precisely at the time when the final support of empowerment specific to each tantra class is completed.

Regarding the distinctive features of the vows thus held: Generally, the meaning of "mantra vows" refers to vidyadhara vows. The vidya to be held is wisdom free from subject-object duality. This need not be newly generated, as it is primordially established and is held through clarification. Though the methods for holding this exist even for practitioners of the Paramitayana, establishing these methods as vows is unique to the Mantrayana. As stated in the Guhyasamaja: "Therefore the mandala wheel is the vow of method and bliss."

Thus, as antidotes to the four subtle and coarse conceptual thoughts of common objects of abandonment regarding subject and object, and the four distinct subtle and coarse habitual tendencies of transformation that are unique objects of abandonment in the Mantrayana, one commits to holding non-dual awareness through four different ritual procedures. The mind that promises to train in those methods along with its seeds constitutes the distinctive vidyadhara vows taught in each of the four tantra classes.

Regarding how desire and conceptual thoughts are distinguished in the four classes: As stated in the Glorious Samvara: "Excitement, looking, holding hands, and mutual embrace are the four types dwelling in the four tantras like insects." Based on this, one holds in one's mindstream the wisdom that purifies these various attachments by using as the path the desires of excitement, looking, holding hands, and union of the two organs. The terms "coarse" for what is easy to abandon and "subtle" for what is difficult are general terminology used by philosophical systems.

Secondly, generally conceptual thoughts are definitively of two types: grasping at persons and grasping at phenomena. The latter has two types: conceptualization of apprehended phenomena and conceptualization of apprehending phenomena. The first also has two: conceptual thought that grasps appearances as real and conceptual thought that grasps there exists some other real referent separate from the appearance. Holding the wisdom of emptiness as antidote to each of these specific conceptual thoughts is what makes one a vidyadhara. Through the distinction of four different ways of holding this, there are four different ritual procedures for taking vows in the four tantra classes, and four different types of vows thus held.

Therefore, since one commits at the time of taking vows to hold emptiness that is empty of either subject-object duality in terms of persons or phenomena, when explaining root downfalls it is taught that doubting naturally pure phenomena and conceptualizing phenomena free of names etc. as such are root downfalls. And in the Yoga Tantra when holding vows it states "That which is bodhicitta is vajra," and [text appears to be cut off]
In the glorious Root Tantra and Vairochana Abhisambodhi, moral discipline is divided into two: conditioned moral discipline and unconditioned moral discipline. When explaining the training of the latter, it states: "The bodhisattva accomplishes the secret mantra by abiding in one dharma. What is this one? It is seeing all dharmas in the aspect of being free from elaboration." The instruction to read the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras at the beginning of the samaya section of the Kriyā Tantra also has this meaning in mind.

Second, regarding the ritual for holding the vows of Highest Yoga Tantra, there are two: the vase empowerment and the ritual for holding vows arising from the higher empowerments. The distinction between these two types of vows is that one holds vows before directly realizing great bliss wisdom, while the other after having realized it. The distinction between these two rituals is that one draws the wisdom indirectly through transmission, while the other draws it directly.

The first has two parts: taking common Yoga Tantra vows during the preliminary empowerment, and taking the uncommon vase empowerment vows during the concluding support. The first is easily understood as it is well-known to all. For the second, as stated in the River of Empowerment, quoting the Vajra Tent: "These spoken teachings should not be disparaged, the teacher should not be disdained, and one should not transgress the Buddha's words" up to "Even for sand maṇḍalas and stūpas, the wise should perform the proper ritual." The meaning of these will be explained in detail.

Thus, these comprise all the samaya and vows of the yogin, and they are proclaimed as such. Then, with the thought that the student should hold these, by reciting three times "I shall do all that the master has commanded," one takes on all the samayas without exception.

Second, for students who have gained stability in the meditation objects of the vase and secret empowerments, whatever ritual of the third empowerment is to be bestowed is the ritual that accomplishes the completion stage vows. The direct realization of great bliss wisdom arising from that - which is not understood by those of the generation stage, let alone the Pāramitāyāna - is explicitly taught in the tantric texts as being designated by the term "vow." In conventional terms, the intention along with its seeds to either generate unborn great bliss wisdom or to practice all secret mantra conduct through the blessing of already-arisen wisdom is the completion stage vow.

As stated: "The co-emergent cannot be spoken by others and is not found anywhere; it should be known through serving the guru's timely methods and one's own merit." And Āryadeva says: "Even after reaching the far shore of learning for billions of eons, one who turns away from blessing will not see reality."

The stages of how to generate such wisdom through serving the guru's timely methods are extensively taught in the tantra: "The vows and empowerments, likewise the intended speech, joy and momentary divisions," up to "Whatever excellent implements of E, adorned in the center with VAṂ, the abode of all bliss, the buddha's jewel casket, divided by momentary divisions, from that joy arises."

Furthermore, the wisdom directly arising from the third empowerment is the exemplifying wisdom, while through familiarizing with its continuity it becomes the exemplified ultimate wisdom. At that time, the yoga of familiarization must be done with the wisdom arising from the fourth empowerment, because the great bliss that is the object-possessor arising in the third empowerment...
When receiving the fourth empowerment, one sees all objects as free from conceptual elaboration. Through familiarizing with that continuum, the wisdom of ultimate meaning becomes manifest. This is also called the supreme siddhi of Mahamudra. For both of these wisdoms, the term "samvara" is clearly used as a direct name in the tantras and commentaries.

Regarding the third empowerment, both the initial wisdom that arises and the wisdom developed through familiarizing with its continuum are considered actual ultimate wisdom according to the renowned Ngok tradition. As evidence for this, it is stated: "Seeing the compassionate disciple, the Vajra-holder speaks thus: 'This itself is great wisdom, present throughout all bodies, the nature of duality and non-duality, the essence of existence and non-existence, pervading the stable and moving, appearing as illusory forms. Through the method of the mandala wheel, one will definitely progress.'"

This is incorrect for two reasons - scriptural and logical. Scripturally, the tantra states: "The great bliss of the elements is not supreme bliss," and the Jnanasiddhi states: "The pleasure of sensory union is supreme, say the lowborn. The Victor Supreme did not teach this as great bliss." Maitripada explains this as the secret system of the tirthikas. Logically, at that time one has not directly realized selflessness of phenomena and in the second moment has not been freed from attachment to appearances.

Nevertheless, the non-dual wisdom that arises then is called "that wisdom" because it resembles buddhajñāna, as stated in the tantra itself: "Omniscient wisdom of that kind." Therefore, according to the Sakya masters' position that the non-dual wisdom manifesting at empowerment is not explained as actual buddhajñāna, what need is there to mention the ground-time wisdom? Still, when the tantras and commentaries explain the meaning-wisdom to be indicated as actual buddhajñāna, this refers to attaining a portion of the dharmakaya's adventitious purity.

Third, regarding the number of root downfalls in the different classes of tantra: First, in Kriya Tantra, the General Secret Tantra states: "Then the guru, having properly seated the disciples without distraction, should read the Prajñāparamita and instruct these samaya: 'From this day forward, you should maintain firm faith in the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, bodhisattvas, and assembly of secret and knowledge mantras. Always maintain special devotion to the Mahayana. Be respectful to samaya-holders, friends, and gurus. Do not hate any deities. Make offerings at the proper times. Do not worship other teachers' traditions. Always make offerings to unexpected guests. Maintain firm loving-kindness toward all beings. Those who delight in Mahayana should strive in merit. Practice mantra recitation diligently and apply yourself to secret mantra conduct. Keep the samayas taught in the secret mantra tantras. Do not give mantras and mudras to those without samaya. Guard the secret mantra tantras well and realize them yourself.'"

According to the Lord Guru's words, the first three are general samayas and the latter thirteen are empowerment samayas. The Kālachakra tantra and commentary state that all four classes of tantra are similar in having fourteen root downfalls. Considering the intention...
Those precepts are condensed into fourteen, as follows: faith in the Three Jewels; faith in mantra; devotion to Mahayana or Mahamudra; respect for the guru and dharma brothers; not having hatred for deities; making offerings at appropriate times; not making offerings to other systems; making spontaneous offerings; not abandoning loving-kindness; striving for merit; diligence in secret mantra; maintaining other commitments; not giving mantra seals to others; and keeping the tantras secret while realizing them.

The opposites of these become root downfalls, as stated in that tantra: "Whoever violates these stated commitments should recite their own family's heart mantra one hundred thousand times, or alternatively recite the fire-bewildering dharani one thousand times, or perform a peaceful fire offering, or alternatively re-enter the mandala."

The Root Tantra of Manjushri states: "O Son of the Victorious Ones, I teach these five as root downfalls: holding nihilistic views, abandoning the Three Jewels, abandoning bodhicitta, rejecting empowerment, and having contempt for the guru." Among these, rejecting empowerment refers to rejecting the empowering guru.

Second, the root downfalls of the Carya Tantra are fourteen: the ten non-virtues and the four root [downfalls]. The four are: rejecting the holy dharma, abandoning bodhicitta, being miserly, and harming sentient beings. As stated in the Abhisambodhitantra: "These ten are the foundation of all training for bodhisattvas practicing at the door of secret mantra," and "The four root downfalls should not be violated even at the cost of one's life."

If asked: Aren't the ten non-virtues abandoned by outsiders and shravakas too? Why are they established as secret mantra commitments? The answer is: Here, bodhisattvas practicing at the door of secret mantra take hold of the unconditioned aggregate of morality and make a commitment not to transgress it. Therefore there is a distinction. As stated in the Vairocana Abhisambodhi: "Those who have trained in method and wisdom, all the protectors of past, present and future, attain unsurpassed enlightenment through that which is unconditioned. Methods without wisdom and trainings explained are taught by the great hero for shravakas to grasp."

The meaning of this appears to be that one should combine the wisdom of emptiness without secret mantra methods, and the trainings without secret mantra wisdom. Understanding this, one can easily know how to refute those later Tibetans who claim "There is no explanation of root downfalls in the two lower tantra classes except for the root downfalls of entering vows."

Third, regarding the establishment of root downfalls in Yoga Tantra, there are two parts: establishing the reasonable portion and the various assertions of the gurus. First, when taking the five family vows: for the first family, the Three Jewels; for the second, vajra, bell and master - three; for the third, the four types of giving; for the fourth, the three dharmas of outer, inner and secret; for the last, only offering activities. The opposites of these fourteen are explained as the root downfalls according to Master Anandagarbha's assertion, as stated in the Mahaprakasha: "The discipline of all Tathagatas is as all the protectors of the three times established for enlightenment..."
As regards qualities that oppose the fourteen root downfalls, and as stated in the Great Commentary on Śrī-paramādya: "These are all accomplished through mere contemplation - what need is there for mudrās and so forth?" This indicates that completely abandoning these results in a downfall.

Second, according to the words of the previous masters, regarding the meaning of the samaya vows taught in Paramārtha, there are two types: the specific samayas of the five Buddha families and the general samayas. 

First, from "The Buddha, Dharma..." up to "...do what one can" explains this. Second, there are root samayas and branch samayas. The first is explained from "Other than those..." up to "...becomes grave."

The meaning is: Those fourteen that are other than these specific samayas are explained as root downfalls in the tantras, therefore they are called root infractions. What are these fourteen? According to the words of Lord Rtse-mo, they are explained as the fourteen downfalls in relation to the bodhisattva vows taught in the Ākāśagarbha Sūtra.

Other earlier Tibetans count them as: the opposites of the five including not killing and abstaining from alcohol; the opposites of serving holy beings and making offerings to yogis - these two; counting the opposites of the ten virtues as one; four including not having desire for the lesser vehicle; disrespect toward deities and others; and meditation on characteristics - making fourteen.

Some say that "the fourteen other than those" refers to the fourteen negative samayas that are other than the fourteen positive samayas. This is identified in Rtse-mo as teaching from "What are those samayas? The Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, these principals should be upheld..." up to "Always abandon improper actions - these are your samaya vows."

Though when examining the scriptural sources cited above the numbers seem to match, the repetition is easily understood through analysis. Later Tibetans say it is incorrect to assert that "the fourteen other than those" refers to qualities opposing the specific samayas of the five families. This is because that very scripture of Snang-chen teaches that the samayas of the five families are opposed to the fourteen root downfalls. This alone cannot indicate their opposites as downfalls. Even if it could, since you have not counted the opposite of generating bodhicitta as a downfall when you should have, and since the Great Commentary on Śrī-paramādya states "Never completely abandon vajra, bell and mudrās," this scripture contradicts your not counting mudrās as samayas of the vajra family.

Therefore these fourteen must refer to the fourteen taught in highest yoga tantra, since the vow-taking ceremonies are similar in the two higher tantra classes and their root downfalls correspond. The fourteen root downfalls are explained in yoga tantra, and if there were other fourteens not from highest yoga tantra, they should have been enumerated in authoritative Indian texts, but no one has done so. Furthermore, in the Commentary on the Condensed Meaning of Vajradhātu and in the commentary on the Sarvadurgatipariśodhana Tantra by the Jālandhara master Kāmadhenu, disrespect toward women is explained as the fourteenth root downfall of yoga tantra.

This is unreasonable because there is no proof and there are contradictions. First, in that case, while the mere number fourteen root downfalls explained in highest yoga tantra should appear in yoga tantra, there is no explanation of this and you yourselves do not assert this. Mere correspondence between some root downfalls in the two higher tantra classes does not establish everything as such. The way of enumerating the fourteen is not explained, and just because the term "fourteen" appears...
If those fourteen root downfalls are established there, then to identify the fourteen root downfalls of the Carya Tantra as the fourteen here would be too extreme. Furthermore, if according to you the fourteen defeats are taken as the five family samayas in opposition, what becomes of the fourteen defeats? There can be nothing other than saying they are the fourteen root downfalls of Highest Yoga Tantra. In that case, these words of taking the five family vows would extremely absurdly become taking the vow to guard the fourteen root downfalls of Highest Yoga Tantra. Moreover, if the fourteen root downfalls are already taken as five family samayas, there would be no need to take "the other fourteen" separately. Those bound by the five family samayas would not be in contradiction with or opposed to the fourteen root downfalls. Since this is not explained in any context of taking vows, it lacks scriptural authority. Although you yourself did not take it as such, you cited the pratimoksha vows as an example of what must be guarded, which contradicts your own assertions. Since it is not explained that the opposites of bodhicitta are defeats, this directly contradicts your own position. Since the earlier tradition's position that abandoning bodhicitta is already explained as a root downfall of the bodhisattva vows, it is not needed here. Therefore, there is no proof.

The second, the refutation, has two parts: contradiction with reasoning and internal contradiction of assertions. First, it would follow that one who has the Yoga Tantra vows must have the Highest Yoga Tantra vows, and one who has the other must also have those vows, because there is not even the slightest difference in the ritual for taking these two types of vows, and you yourself assert that apart from the vow-taking ritual, there are no other causes for obtaining tantric vows in either case.

Second, it would follow that one who has the Yoga Tantra vows need not guard the Highest Yoga Tantra vows, because they have only taken the five family samayas and have not taken vows in terms of Highest Yoga Tantra. Although you accept this pervasion, the example is that just as in Kriya and Carya tantras there is no need to guard tantric vows because nothing other than the bodhisattva vows is accepted.

Fourth, regarding the root downfalls in relation to Highest Yoga Tantra: Although there are two levels of vows in Highest Yoga Tantra, the root downfalls are definitely just these fourteen, because although two types of vows are explained in terms of empowerment divisions, no different divisions are explained for root downfalls. And the reasoning is established that nothing additional to the previous is explained, because it is taught in Kalachakra that if any of the fourteen root downfalls occur after obtaining the completion stage vows, there is no means of purification through punishment.

The enumeration and identification of the fourteen of Highest Yoga Tantra are well-known to all, so for now I have focused on what is easily understood. Nevertheless, regarding what aspects the vows obtained from the higher empowerments restrict and what concordant aspects they accomplish, as stated when Vajragarbha asked: "By what vows and what samayas should one abide?" The Bhagavan replied: "You should kill living beings, speak false words, take what is not given, and consort with others' wives. The mind itself is called the life force of living beings. Liberating beings from samsara is proclaimed as false speech. The consort's essence not given is like one's own beautiful wife."

Second, giving a brief response: The four classes of tantra each have their own distinct vows and samayas obtained through their respective rituals, and root downfalls are explained separately. The vows, samayas and downfalls of each lower class are included within the vows and downfalls of each higher class. Even those who have vows of lower tantras in this life...
If one wishes to achieve liberation in mind:
After receiving the four empowerments of supreme yoga, one should meditate on them. The samaya of completion stage has two wisdoms - the example wisdom and the actual wisdom. The example wisdom arises directly from the empowerment ritual, as is clear in the texts. Understanding that very wisdom to be empty like space, through familiarization with that, one sees the actual wisdom of mahamudra. If these two wisdoms are not attained, in order to achieve and stabilize them, the method of the mandala wheel is taught. When this is labeled as "the samaya of the higher empowerments," the conventional designation becomes easy. This agrees with what is stated in the Guhyasamaja: "The method of the mandala wheel is the samaya of bliss."

Though explaining some meanings not meant to be explained may be too extreme, it is done to benefit those who teach and learn, and to put the teachings into practice. This great wish-fulfilling ocean of treatises, because its main subject matter is profound, can illustrate the ocean of teachings - not just through the beauty of its verbal garlands.

Regarding the twentieth question: "Why did Lo-chen Gos explain that the treatise known as 'The Four Mudras' present in Tibet was not composed by Nagarjuna?" There are two parts to this. First, the reason for asking: Because it is cited as evidence that mahamudra is a special feature of highest tantra, saying "Even noble Nagarjuna himself stated thus in the Four Mudras," and because the great translator Gos and Phorang Zhiwa Ö approved of the refutation of wrong mantras. The fault of not asking would be: This seems to conflict with Abhayakara's explanation in the Snyema that the treatise Four Mudras attributed to Nagarjuna was not composed by him, and with statements in Phorang Zhiwa Ö's refutation of wrong mantras that various sadhanas attributed to Nagarjuna - the Four Mudras, Five Mudras, their instructions, the blessing of Yogini, blessing of Varahi, the Twenty and Thirty Verses of Mahayana, definitive teaching on illusion, definitive teaching on dreams, etc. - agree with other views, and their completion stage practices and instructions agree with non-Buddhist methods and are thus invalid.

The actual response: In general, whether these doubts are well-founded or whether there are other scriptural and logical proofs, since some masters who compiled the catalog of the Tengyur appear to have rejected them, it is difficult to explain definitively. However, according to this treatise's system, when accepting that he composed it, Abhaya's system cannot be valid as authority since this treatise establishes many precedents. Those who composed refutations of wrong mantras merely listed items and what they stated need not be taken as authoritative, because they claim the Bindus of Mahamudra, Jnana Bindu and Three Rains tantras were composed by Krishnacharya, and they claim the great commentary on Pradipodyotana by Bhavyakirti and Nagabodhi's commentary on the Five Stages called Ratnamala are impure, while many Indian authorities explain these as pure. And since the Twenty Verses of Mahayana, Definitive Teaching on Illusion and so forth are accepted as authoritative by many great uncontested masters, even if those were not composed by him, since earlier parties accepted them as his works and their meaning is established through pure scripture and reasoning, there is no fault of their becoming mere semblance of proof here.
At this point, regarding Mahāmudrā, regarding the various scriptural citations and logical arguments refuting misconceptions: In Tibet, those known as the Mahāmudrā practitioners consider the Madhyamaka view to be Mahāmudrā. Among them, some consider the realization that appearances are mind to be Mahāmudrā. Some consider the non-dual wisdom of self-awareness and self-illumination free from subject and object to be the Mahāmudrā view. Yet others consider the realization that all phenomena are empty of inherent nature to be the Mahāmudrā view.

The term Mahāmudrā is not absent from the Pāramitāyāna, as explained by Maitreya that the term appears in the Pāramitāyāna, and there are mentions of the jewel mudra samādhi and terminology related to definite and indefinite mudrās. This is known by examining their scriptures in detail.

Particularly in the Single Intent (Dgongs gcig), it states: "What is called Mahāmudrā is this awareness itself. Maintaining unwavering attention to that is meditation on the natural dharmakāya. The enhancement of Mahāmudrā is devotion to the authentic guru."

Furthermore, it states that Mahāmudrā and the prātimokṣa discipline are of the same meaning. Also, that realizing all appearances as mind is Mahāmudrā. And that "my Mahāmudrā and the view of the Uttaratantra are of the same meaning."

It also states that this Mahāmudrā view was not reached by three great ones: The culmination of the Characteristic Vehicle, the Great Madhyamaka, did not reach it. Of the two New and Old Secret Mantra schools, the ultimate of the Old School is Atiyoga or Dzogchen, which also did not reach it. The ultimate of the New School is the signless completion stage Mahāmudrā, which also did not reach it. These three greats are intellectual measurements and verbal expressions, while our realization of mind itself transcends the domain of intellect.

Making these points the basis for refutation, there are texts that equate contemporary Mahāmudrā and Chinese-style Dzogchen and refute them both. The term "white panacea" (dkar po gcig thub) appears to have been used by Lord Gampopa. In the Single Intent, Lord Gampopa used medicine as an example, saying "My realization of mind itself is like a white panacea." When a great scholar challenged this, asking "Does your white panacea need dedication and bodhicitta or not?" he replied, "From the perspective of the panacea itself, it's not needed. You can say it's a self-sufficient cure just for liberation from samsara."

However, while there seems to be no better or worse difference in view between the Kagyü and the Chinese master, there is a difference in conduct. This tradition emphasizes karma, cause and effect, and the three trainings of discipline very strictly, as is very clear from examining their scriptures. Therefore they should not be disparaged. Even in this text, statements like "Some say after meditating on the self-sufficient [practice], dedication is necessary" refer to the lineage holders of Lord Gampopa.

Thus, the main objects of refutation here are the misidentification of Mahāmudrā and the application of the term "white panacea," not the assertion that contemporary Mahāmudrā practitioners practice whatever the Chinese master's doctrine is. Generally, the mere term "Mahāmudrā" appears even in the Kriyā and Caryā tantras, as in "Devotion to the great seal..." and so forth. In the Yoga tantras all four mudrās are explained, and in the Highest Yoga tantras, the action...
The wisdom seal, the great seal, and the action seal are the three divisions. The fourth is the division of the action, wisdom, and dharma seals. Without dividing any of these, the unified body is explained as Mahamudra, and the fourth empowerment wisdom is explained as Mahamudra. Although there are many such explanations, according to the earlier position, considering either the Madhyamaka or Cittamatra view from the Paramitayana as Mahamudra is incorrect, because this is not generally explained in the scriptures, and particularly because you claim to follow Naropa and Maitripa, who do not assert this view.

The twenty-first question asks: If you reject that qualities arise immediately after death when the body's seal is broken, how does the sambhogakaya arise in the bardo from the dharmakaya of clear light death?

The reason for this question is that some identify the path of seeing with a slight degree of shamatha and subtle realization of appearance-emptiness. They say that just as a garuda is bound within its egg, one is bound by the body's seal, and qualities will arise after death when the body's seal is broken. When refuting this by using the analogy of today's sunlight arising tomorrow morning, they appear to reject that the twelve hundred qualities, such as the ability to emanate hundreds of bodies, arise after death for those who attain the Mahayana path of seeing in this life.

If this question were not asked, these problems would arise: It would become impossible for someone who directly realizes emptiness, called clear light in this life, to not manifest the unified body of a trainee as its support. It would become impossible to manifest the dharmakaya in this life and then manifest the sambhogakaya later, because there would be no difference between being bound or unbound by the body's seal in manifesting the qualities after directly realizing emptiness.

The proof that this position is untenable comes from the Guhyasamaja, which teaches two approaches: the diligent achieve enlightenment in this life, while the lazy achieve it in the bardo. Explaining the second approach, the Caryamelāpakapradīpa states: The vajra student asked, "If practitioners see the truth but, due to previous habitual tendencies, are distracted by farming, business, and services, and do not practice the three types of conduct, or if other practitioners cannot complete the prescribed rituals due to incomplete resources, when they die, will they take another rebirth or attain vajradhara status?"

The vajra master replied: "There is nothing to remove, nothing to add. Look at reality itself correctly. Seeing reality correctly brings liberation." These words refer to those established in the completion stage. Seeing reality correctly means that wrong views of permanence, annihilation, and transition cease through seeing reality. However, conventionally, pure transition must be practiced. The aggregates and so forth do not transition to the next world, as this would result in the fault of permanence. Neither does the next world arise from anything other than death, as this would result in the fault of causelessness. Just as with a flame from a flame, a seal from a seal, and an echo from a sound, one cannot say whether it is the same or different. Therefore, like the Golden Light...
From the Sutra it is said: "The Buddha does not pass into nirvana, and the Dharma does not decline. The demonstration of passing into nirvana is shown for the sake of taming beings." And from the Lankavatara Sutra...

The wisdom of those still learning and those beyond learning are the two types. The first is the union of the illusory body with the wisdom of a learner. The second is the union of the complete sambhogakaya with the wisdom of one beyond learning. Since it is impossible for the dharmakaya and sambhogakaya of a buddha to be separated, this doubt must be abandoned.

Secondly, other Tibetans' assertion that realizing the clear light at death is not directly realizing ultimate reality is incorrect. The clear light realized at death has two aspects - the example clear light and the actual wisdom. Regarding the second, it is nothing other than directly seeing ultimate reality. Regarding the first, it contradicts the Compendium of Conduct, because the earlier-cited passage explains that one who realizes clear light at death must have previously seen the truth. Without having previously generated even example wisdom, there would be no purpose in seeing the truth.

Secondly, giving the actual response: According to this treatise's author, the statement in the Compendium of Conduct "although seeing the truth..." appears to refer to example wisdom. At that time, the merging with death clear light must be explained as realizing actual clear light. Even so, this death clear light does not exist within this life's support, because the manifestation of that clear light and the cessation of this life's death existence are simultaneous.

The proof of this: For all beings, the death clear light - the ultimate brief moment at the end of time - does not arise as long as the death existence has not ceased. As long as the alaya consciousness included in this life's karma has not dissolved into clear light, one will not manifest the death clear light. When it does dissolve, one is designated as having died.

For those without oral instructions, nothing more than the final moment of clear light arises, and the cessation of this life's death existence and establishment of the next existence occur like the rising and falling of a scale beam. For those with instructions who have manifested example clear light, when meeting with the ground-time clear light it becomes actual clear light. Arising from that, they manifest the union of a learner and either attain enlightenment or proceed to the state of a vidyadhara, etc.

For those with instructions who have generated actual clear light in their mindstream, by merging it with the ground-time clear light, they realize the ultimate truth and attain enlightenment through manifesting the union beyond learning. For yogis who have neither manifested the two clear lights but have well-trained in the instructions of mental isolation or illusory body - when meeting the ground-time clear light, they manifest example wisdom but cannot attain the unified kaya, so take rebirth in whatever realm they desire.

These three capabilities come through the force of previous impetus, as is clear from the just-cited passage from the Compendium of Conduct. The earlier masters applied the term "meeting of mother and child clear light" to this system. Such an occurrence does not belong to the next life since no future existence has manifested. Nevertheless, this is designated by the term "enlightenment in the bardo" because enlightenment occurs in the interval between the cessation of this life's death existence and establishment of the next life's birth existence. Furthermore, in the bardo...
When one manifests the trainee's yuganaddha, after training in any of the three practices, one either attains enlightenment or, having first created aspirations for wherever one wishes to take rebirth, takes birth there. At that time, there is no distinct intermediate state - the yuganaddha form itself enters in the manner of a bardo state, as the ancient masters have said.

If both forms of yuganaddha are explained as bodies formed from the pure essence of wind-mind, one might ask whether such pure wind is composed of the elements of this life. It is not, because it transcends the nature of subtle particles.

What then? The naturally luminous mind itself, in its moving aspect, is called pure wind. During the trainee's yuganaddha, this dwells within the practitioner's gross body, not conflicting with its limitations. At that time, although bound by bodily limitations, one can display all qualities like multiplying into a hundred bodies.

When manifesting the non-trainee's yuganaddha, whether following the system where the practitioner's body transforms into the yuganaddha form like refined alchemical gold, or the system where it is shed like a snake's skin, that very vajra of bodhicitta becomes inseparable from the nature of the three kayas. The rainbow-like appearance described is not included within buddhahood, as it belongs to the perspective of other beings to be trained.

This much elaboration suffices. On this topic it is said:
The clear light of death
Is not contained within this existence.
Therefore the dharmakaya and sambhogakaya
Are simultaneously accomplished in one bodily support.
What is called clear light is the antidote
That purifies the habitual patterns of the illusory body.
Through partial and complete divisions
Two types of yuganaddha are manifested.
The illusory body is the mental body,
The essence of pure wind-mind.
Since this is ordinary beings' mental body
It is conventional truth.
Until this is manifested,
The deity's form of completion stage
Will not arise, therefore through the three isolations
And generation stage this should be accomplished.
Having purified this through clear light,
When non-trainee wisdom manifests,
Dharmakaya and illusory body
Are established as ultimate truth yuganaddha.

The twenty-second question asks:
"Doesn't this entail that buddhas of paramita and tantra
Must be with and without ornaments?"

This has two parts. First, the reason for the question: According to the earlier position in this treatise, since path of seeing attained through paramitayana can display the hundred and twelve qualities it has ornaments, while path of seeing attained through tantrayana cannot and thus lacks ornaments. Therefore this implies the buddhas attained through these two methods must also be with and without ornaments.

The problem with not asking has two aspects: considering how this position's earlier proponents would respond, and how others would respond. For the first: The earlier proponents explain that while someone like King Indrabhuti attained the yuganaddha form in that support but did not display the twelve deeds and thus was unornamented, whereas the Teacher, the Sage, attaining buddhahood in the support of being the son of King Śuddhodana, as explained in the Caryāsamgraha and by Master Śākyamitra, is explained as a buddha established by common appearance in both mahāyāna approaches - being ornamented by displaying the twelve deeds. They suspected this. And most early Guhyasamāja practitioners...

[Note: The text appears to continue but is cut off mid-sentence]
In the case where one manifests the Nirmāṇakāya through yogic practice, if one does not perform the twelve deeds of a Buddha's emanation body, there is no adornment. Regarding the second point, following the thrust of that argument, since there would be no distinction between the two types of Buddhas in terms of having or lacking adornments, this appears to conflict with what is stated in the Commentary on Praise to Selflessness, where the author himself says there is a difference between the two types of Buddhas, like the difference between a myrobalan fruit washed in milk versus one washed in water.

One might wonder: When attaining Buddhahood in a human body through the Vajrayāna, although one achieves the Dharmakāya, does one achieve the Sambhogakāya and supreme Nirmāṇakāya or not? If one does, it would follow that one possesses the five certainties and displays the twelve deeds. If not, it would follow that a Vajrayāna Buddha lacks adornments.

In response: For one who attains Buddhahood through the Vajrayāna in a human body, there is no fault of lacking adornments due to incompleteness of the three kāyas at one time. Although the two form bodies may not appear to other disciples at that time and place, the three kāyas in terms of their ultimate nature are established inseparably from realization and bliss. Since all Buddhas' Dharmakāya is unified and all enlightened activities are considered as one, as explained in the Uttaratantra, all appearances of the two form bodies to other disciples must also be explained as form bodies of that newly enlightened Buddha. The identification of the ultimate Sambhogakāya and Nirmāṇakāya is explained in terms of mirror-like wisdom and all-accomplishing wisdom. Until these two wisdoms are manifested, even enlightenment into the Dharmakāya cannot occur.

The twenty-third question asks: Isn't it clearly stated in the Vinaya sūtras and scriptures that one who has not obtained full monastic ordination can serve as preceptor and teacher?

Regarding this, first, the reason for asking is that in explaining the text "Acting as preceptor and teacher without full ordination is like trying to take jewels from a poisonous snake's head without mantras - it becomes a cause of destroying oneself and others," the commentators appear to give no explanation beyond the literal meaning.

If not asked about this, one might doubt: If those not fully ordained cannot be preceptors, what about the statement in the Vinaya root text that says "even if one is not fully ordained" where the word "even" relates to the earlier explanation of generating vows? And from the Lung Zhuba: "If one who has committed the five immediate misdeeds, or is a tīrthika, or has joined the tīrthikas, or is a novice monk performs the formal act of full ordination with four formal requests, the candidate becomes fully ordained, though the Sangha incurs a transgression."

In response: The first analysis is not a valid refutation because the statement from the root text is explained in that same passage: "If one knows they are not actually a monk, [the vows] do not arise." This refers to cases where one mistakenly perceives someone who is not a monk as a monk and makes them preceptor. Here, however, we are discussing cases where one knows the person is not fully ordained and makes them preceptor.
Indeed, regarding the second analysis, it does not contradict, since what is explained in this treatise means that those who are not fully ordained are not suitable as substitutes for ritual actions. Although it is possible that someone unsuitable as a substitute might become a ritual performer, they can never be suitable as a ritual master. With this meaning in mind, the Vinaya Sutra states "These are not actually performers," and the Vinaya commentators also explain that those suitable as ritual masters must possess the qualities of being proper substitutes as a necessary component.

What is stated in the scriptural sources refers to when fully ordained monks are extremely scarce, those who are not fully ordained but have memorized the mantra procedures and can communicate with the sangha may, without actually serving as substitutes, remain in another boundary or stand upright, and when they convey the mantra procedure to complete the required number of substitutes for full ordination, at the time the ritual is experienced by the candidate and the substitute monks' assembly, it is intended that ordination vows arise in the candidate's continuum. This is stated in the Extensive Questions and in the Sutra which says "For full ordination, there should be ten or more. In border regions, if unavailable, five or more including a Vinaya holder."

The reason for specifically mentioning the Vinaya holder is that it considers cases where the Vinaya holder may not necessarily act as a substitute. If asked whether the extensive commentary doesn't explain the ritual performer as the main substitute - while it does explain this, it refers to cases where the ritual performer also acts as a substitute, since at that time such a person becomes the ritual master. In general, there is no necessity for the ritual performer to be a substitute, like in requesting novice ordination or requesting to enter for private instruction.

Similarly, to become a private instructor requires someone suitable as a substitute since the sangha must gather there to appoint them. But this is not needed just to become a private teacher, since merely being able to clearly recite the mantra procedure for privately asking about obstacles and requesting to enter the sangha is sufficient to fulfill the role of private instructor.

The twenty-fourth question asks: "For the kha 'bar ma torma offerings, if it's inappropriate to first recite the names of the four Tathagatas, why did venerable Grags pa compose it that way? Isn't 'namo sarva tathā...' a mantra paying homage to all Tathagatas?"

Regarding this, there are two parts. First, the reason for asking is that among the commentators, nothing appears other than the literal meaning of the text. The fault of not asking is that it conflicts with what appears in a printed copy of the Hundred Tormas composed by the venerable one, which states that for five or fewer, first recite the names of the four Tathagatas and then recite the mantras. Also, if the Buddhas' names should be recited after the mantras, it conflicts with the great torma text by the venerable one which states "Recite the mantra seven times with the supreme right-giving dharma-source mudra, turn the right mudra face down and briefly touch the five offerings. The names of the four Tathagatas are not recited."

If one thinks the former text must be incorrect, even granting that, what fault is there in reciting the names of the four Tathagatas before the mantras? Some say "Those who have not taken refuge in the Buddha will not obtain the torma." But this conflicts with the words paying homage to all Tathagatas appearing at the beginning of the torma mantras.
When blessing the torma, first pay homage to all the Tathagatas and Noble Avalokiteshvara. Through the power of their truth, whatever is desired will be blessed. After the blessing, recite the names of the four Tathagatas.

This represents the gift of Dharma and the gift of fearlessness. Offering the torma is a material gift. Now, why are the names of the four Buddhas recited before the other fifteen sets but only afterward in the ninth set? This is due to the Buddha's prescription, as stated in the dharani for protecting those whose mouths burn like hungry ghosts: "Place the right hand above the vessel, recite this dharani seven times, then recite the names of the four Tathagatas."

The twenty-fifth question asks: Is the Sutra of the Medicine King considered a sutra or tantra when distinguishing between the two? If the former, why does it contain tantric rituals? If the latter, how does this address the current debate?

This question arises because when examining the text, the earlier position cites the sutra's description "golden-colored skin, thin skin" as evidence for the five families being golden-yellow. This raises the concern that the Medicine Buddha's color should also be yellow, which would contradict the blue color described in the sutra itself.

The issue with not asking this is: When refuting the evidence that the five families are yellow according to the sutra system, is the Medicine Buddha Sutra a sutra or tantra? If a sutra, it contradicts Shantarakshita's tantric interpretation. If he didn't interpret it as tantra, it contradicts the statement that "the difference between sutra and tantra is the presence or absence of ritual practices." If a tantra, how is it relevant to cite a tantric Buddha to refute the sutra system's golden Buddhas? If there is a connection, why focus on the Medicine Buddha's color rather than Kalacakra, Hevajra, or Chakrasamvara?

The answer is: The Medicine Buddha Sutra is definitively a sutra in its basic format. Therefore, when it's cited as evidence for the five families being golden-yellow, its description of the Medicine Buddha as having lapis lazuli light serves as a counter-example. While it's fundamentally a sutra, the treatise "Seven Tathagata Ritual Compiled from Sutras" by Bodhisattva interprets it as tantra, as it contains all the distinctive features of tantric interpretation.

The twenty-sixth question asks: If the confession tantra system is not accepted, how does this treatise's author categorize the thirty-five Buddhas into the five families? The reason for this question is that commentators have maintained the literal reading of the text, stating that it's impossible to interpret the confession Buddhas in a tantric way, arguing that it would be inappropriate to depict renunciates holding weapons in their ritual practices. The problem with not asking this is: If so, how does this treatise author's arrangement of the thirty-five Buddhas' colors and hand implements in his treatise...
The thirty-five Tathāgatas are invited to appear in front and homage is paid, and though this is not inherently a tantric system, it is not contradictory for tantric sādhanas to arise for the deities that appear there. Just as it is not contradictory for there to be highest yoga tantra sādhanas for deities taught in kriyā tantra, and just as there are sādhanas corresponding to all four classes of tantra for the Prajñāpāramitā that appears in the extensive, medium and condensed Mother sūtras.

When performing the confession ritual according to the tantric sādhana method, regarding the colors and mudras of the Five Families - some earlier scholars accepted this as being like the sādhanas of Nāgārjuna, Ḍārika and others, not claiming these were tantric systems themselves, but rather accepting that the sūtra and its explicit teachings themselves were tantric. The basis for this confusion was thinking that since the Confession Sūtra describes inviting and prostrating to the thirty-five Tathāgatas, and since the Heart Sūtra describes reciting mantras, these must be tantric.

The proof that this correlation is uncertain can be seen in examples like the Samantabhadra Prayer. In the Vinaya texts there are mantras for entering the city of Vaiśālī and pacifying epidemics. The Śikṣāsamuccaya contains many mantras for defeating māras, stabilizing bodhicitta, and the hundred-syllable mantra of the Tathāgata. Similarly, this refutes claims that the Medicine Buddha Sūtra and Amitāyus Sūtra are tantric, or that a single verse on dependent origination is tantric, or that the accounts of the eighty mahāsiddhas and sixteen arhats are tantric. However, if individual masters who received permission from personal deities interpreted these as tantric, this is not refuted.

This can be understood through examples: just as the sixteen śrāvakas like Subhūti, the twelve pratyekabuddhas, and the thousand fortunate bodhisattvas and others - though these individuals of the three types who emerge from the pāramitāyāna are not inherently tantric deities, it is not contradictory for various tantras and sādhana texts to interpret them as such.

The twenty-eighth question asks: "If Mahāketu's rituals describe the assembly of Guhyasamāja deities as coming from the sūtras - like Avalokiteśvara, Mañjuśrī, and Vajrapāṇi - what was his intention in composing this?" Regarding this, there are two parts. First, the reason for asking is that the text literally states "These days some meditate on Guhyasamāja deities and claim it is the sūtra system."

In general, it appears to explain that sūtra-style rituals are impossible for tantric deities and specifically Guhyasamāja deities. The commentators also do not seem to add any significant clarification on this point. The fault of not asking would be: if this were so, it would mean there could be no sūtra-style ritual practices of meditation on deities like the Five Families, the ten wrathful ones, the eight bodhisattvas, and the twelve great yakṣa generals. This would contradict the presentation of the Five Families in the Golden Light Sūtra and the stages of meditation on those deities as described in the Medicine Buddha sūtra ritual where they are invited to appear. As it is said, "If a lion cub came from an elephant, it would be an unprecedented creature."
If Yoga Tantra rituals for unsurpassable deities arise, the same [issue] applies. If texts teaching self-emptiness like the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā are interpreted according to Yogācāra texts, it would follow that they are like newly created living beings. If accepted, then the system established by the great adept Ānandagarbha interpreting the Guhyasamāja as Yoga Tantra, and the chariot tradition of Abhayākaragupta interpreting Nāgārjuna's intent as other-emptiness would not be pure chariot traditions concerning this teaching.

Second, the actual response: The earlier position accepted by Kadampa spiritual friends states that for deities like Avalokiteśvara and Mañjuśrī from the Guhyasamāja, they composed and accepted practicing meditation rituals that were sūtra-style sādhanas rather than tantric sādhanas. Though some commentators on this treatise appear to give such explanations, this is not correct. 

What then? At the bottom of five painted scrolls of the gentle golden Five Families, the assembly of Guhyasamāja Mañjuvajra deities are arranged with colors and implements exactly according to Jñānapāda's sādhana. Performing sūtra-style prostrations and offerings to these is said to come from the Guhyasamāja sūtra tradition, the instructions of Lord Atiśa.

This text was spoken to refute that claim. Its meaning is that those deities with three faces - blue, white and red - and six arms would have to come from the sūtras. This would be like a lion cub being born from an elephant.

Without examining such questioner's intent,
Some proudly claim these questions are trivial.
Without clever discerning analysis,
Their casual explanations to childish minds,
Are they not just seemingly beautiful?

The twenty-ninth question: "If consecration is not appropriate with just a vajra student empowerment, doesn't this contradict the explanation of deity meditation through steadfast abiding as the actual basis for consecration?" This has two parts. First, the reason for asking: None of the commentators give any explanation beyond the literal words of the text from "deity meditation and mantra recitation" through "performing extensive auspiciousness." The fault of not asking: If that alone constitutes complete consecration, then it should be suitable even for one who has received just a vajra student empowerment, since this very text clearly teaches they have authority to perform these through the lines from "merely vajra student empowerment" through "has authority to hear some secret mantras."

Second, the actual response: Though such doubts arise from the literal meaning, there is no fault in the intended meaning, since consecration empowerment for the three supports is the actual basis, as established through reasoning of inappropriateness. As Lo-chen states in the summary verses of actual consecration: "Perform empowerment, offerings, praise and opening eyes, supplication, bestowal and expansion."

The thirtieth question: "If consecration is not appropriate for one who is not a vajra master, how is it suitable for those with just Kriyā and Caryā empowerments? Do those tantra classes themselves accept vajra master empowerment? If accepted, from which tantric scripture does it come?"

This has two parts. First, the reason for asking: The explicit teaching of the text is that even with just student empowerment but without master empowerment...
Those who have become suitable through receiving both the master and student empowerments are clearly within the context of the higher yoga tantras. How is this so? Both are indicated by the term "vajra," and although the terminology of empowerment for becoming a master exists in the lower tantras, the specific term "vajra master empowerment" does not appear. This terminology must be applied to the conferral of Vajrasattva empowerment. The text states: "Having received the vajra master empowerment, one meditates on the pure mandala of the wheel deities and so forth," clearly indicating the higher yoga context.

In the text commentary by Kumāra on the phrase "merely the vajra student empowerment," when asked about the student empowerment, he emphasizes the five knowledge empowerments and related factors. The fault of not asking about this is: when one who has completely received the empowerments of both Kriya and Charya tantras including the final support, but has not received the empowerments of the two higher yogas, it would be improper for such a knowledge-holder to perform the master's activities like teaching tantra, conferring empowerment, and consecration. Not only have they not received the vajra master empowerment, but since they have not fully received the five knowledge empowerments, they lack even the basic vajra student empowerment. If this were accepted as fundamental, one might worry that without masters who have received both higher yoga empowerments, the teachings of Kriya and Charya would be discontinued.

The actual response is: The distinction made in this text between those who have and have not received the vajra student and master empowerments in terms of their qualification to perform consecration applies universally to all four classes of tantra. If this were not so, it would contradict many scriptures and lead to absurd consequences. Thus, although there is no clear terminology distinguishing vajra student and master empowerments in the Kriya and Charya empowerments, there is the term "empowerment for becoming one's respective master." After receiving this empowerment and being authorized as a master, one must be a vajra master, and therefore in a broader sense, this empowerment can properly be termed a "vajra master empowerment."

Regarding how the terminology of master empowerment exists, the General Secret Tantra states: "For seeing the divine families, there are four types of empowerment. The guru, in meditative equipoise, should perform these as appropriate after understanding them. The first is proclaimed for attaining the master's level. The second is well explained for accomplishing the mantras. The third is proclaimed for thoroughly destroying obstacles. The fourth is explained as the extensive ritual for attaining prosperity."

The identification of these empowerments is: the first includes the water and crown empowerments; the second includes giving permission for recitation; the third must be explained in terms of ablution and the three protections; and the fourth must be explained in terms of proclaiming auspiciousness through the eight auspicious substances and so forth. Thus spoke the precious master.

Even so, among the knowledge-holders who have completely received these empowerments in the Kriya and Charya mandalas, there are two types: those of student lineage and those of master lineage. The first are the majority who have received the empowerments as suitable vessels. The second are the few among them who are suitable to be masters - one, two, or so forth - who are placed on special empowerment seats, crowned with parasols, worshipped and served, and blessed with many auspicious substances while being told: "Now you have become a mandala master, you will hold the mantras and tantras," and so forth.
As spoken, likewise in the Vajrapani Empowerment:
"Placing vajra in the right hand and wheel in the left hand, say these words to the student: 'You have become the vajra master...' up to 'Just as the wheel-turning king is empowered to become lord, likewise for empowerment as Dharma king, the wise vajra master is proclaimed to be empowered.'"

When explained thus, the master empowerment mentioned first among the four empowerments is not the master empowerment that enables one to perform the activities of the vajra master at will, because there is no student empowerment other than that, and because the main ritual that makes one a vajra master must be established in the authorization ceremonies just described, such as placing [the implements] on the empowerment platform. Otherwise, it would follow that one should take the five family vows before the kriya-carya empowerments, because authoritative texts state that taking these vows must precede receiving proper empowerment as a vajra master.

If one examines whether someone who has only received the five awareness empowerments in an unexcelled mandala, without having received empowerment in the lower tantras, is qualified to perform consecrations - while the explicit teachings seem to indicate this is not permitted, when considering the general importance, it must be explained that such a person may perform consecrations through the kriya-carya approach. This is based on passages in unexcelled mandala rituals describing such a person as suitable to be a kriya-carya master, and the reasoning that they have completely received the empowerments that make one a master as explained in kriya-carya.

If one thinks it is inappropriate to give empowerments to others without having received the kriya-carya empowerments oneself - while this might seem to need to be explained as inappropriate in our own system, there is no certainty, as stated in the General Tantra:

"One who receives empowerment in the Tathagata mandala becomes a master of mandalas etc. of all three families. One empowered in Avalokiteshvara's mandala becomes empowered as master of two families' mandalas. One empowered in Vajrapani's glorious mandala becomes master of vajra family mandalas only. All mandalas described of fierce dakinis and yakshas may be drawn without hesitation by all of these."

There are two types called master empowerment: the authorization to become a master explained in kriya-carya, and the vajra master empowerment from the higher tantras. The latter also has two types: that from yoga tantra and that from highest yoga tantra. This also has two types: designation based only on the vase empowerment, and designation based on complete receipt of all four empowerments. The latter is more important, as the Vajra Heart Commentary states: "One is not a master through vase empowerment alone, as this lacks the definitive characteristics of a master." And the Kalachakra also teaches the vajra master lord empowerment after completing all four empowerments.

Although these fine distinctions between actual and imputed exist, there is no contradiction as the term empowerment is very commonly applied to authorizations.

The thirty-first question asks: "In kriya tantra, what is meant by teaching five families when the three families, jewel family and expansive family are not established?" Regarding this, first the reason for asking is that passages state: "In the kriya-carya tantras, the five buddha families are not included" and "Though the five families' meaning is accomplished in carya tantra, the convention does not exist."
Although all Buddhas are subsumed within the five families, which is equally absent in both Kriyā and Caryā tantras, in Kriyā tantra both the meaning and terminology of the five families are absent, while in Caryā tantra, though the terminology of the five families is absent, only their meaning is taught.

Like this explanation, both Samyepa and Kumāra explained the meaning of the five families in Caryā tantra using the Sarvadurgatipariśodhana tantra as their textual basis. They explained that Kunrik represents Vairocana's meaning, Śodhanarajā represents Akṣobhya's meaning, Ratnarāja represents Ratnasambhava's meaning, Śākyendra represents Amitābha's meaning, and Mahāpuṣpa represents Amoghasiddhi's meaning. However, while these meanings are present, their terminology is not applied.

The body colors and hand gestures differ from those explained in Yoga tantra. Vairocana and Śodhanarajā are both white with meditation mudrās, Ratnarāja is blue with the supreme giving mudrā, and Śākyendra is yellow with the dharma teaching mudrā.

Gadongpa connects this to the Sarvadurgatipariśodhana tantra that the former position considers a Caryā tantra, and explains it similarly.

Regarding the second fault of not asking: One might think that the meaning of the five families should also be established in Kriyā tantra, since it explains six families - five transcendent families (Tathāgata, Padma, Vajra, Ratna, and Extended families) and one worldly family. The first five correspond to the five victor families, as there is no dispute that the three families are explained as their respective families in higher tantras, ratna is a type of jewel, and the extended family can only be the karma family, as it is taught as the class of deities accomplishing various activities like increasing wealth and lineage.

If this much is insufficient to establish the meaning of the five families, it would also be difficult to establish their meaning in Caryā tantra, since the subsumption of all Buddhas within five families does not appear there either, and you yourself accept its absence.

In response to this: Although the deities described in Kriyā tantra do well establish both the meaning and terminology of the five Tathāgata families, this alone does not result in the fault of Kriyā tantra becoming a subsumption of Buddhas into five families. For such a classification, one needs an arrangement of deities within a single maṇḍala that includes the five victor families complete, applying them either to purify the five aggregates or, as in Kālacakra, to purify the five elements, with different colors and mudrās. Since nothing like this is found in any of the six divisions of Kriyā tantra, this classification of the five major families required in higher yoga maṇḍalas is primarily from the perspective of the principal deities.

There is no universal rule that all deities arranged in the maṇḍalas of the two higher tantra classes must be subsumed within the five major families with different colors and mudrās, because this may not occur in some of their subsidiary aspects, and may not occur when a single family is divided into five families.

If one asks what then is meant by the five families being established in Kriyā tantra, [text appears to be cut off]
The deities taught in a single mandala are not condensed into five or six, rather it pertains to all tantras of the Kriya class being condensed into six tantra sections. All Kriya tantras are condensed into six classifications including the Tathagata family tantra and Padma family tantra. Within each of these, as appropriate, there are distinct tantric subdivisions related to the family's principal deity, family lord, family mother, crown protuberance, family wrathful male and female deities, and family male and female messengers.

Since a single Kriya tantra mandala's deities do not completely include all three or five families, these six tantra sections are condensed into three family tantras, which further condense into two: secret mantra tantras and knowledge mantra tantras. The distinction between these two is that secret mantra tantras primarily emphasize method and male deities, while knowledge mantra tantras primarily emphasize wisdom and female deities. Thus spoke the previous masters.

Regarding the thirty-second question about which textual source teaches the Padma family among the five families in Carya tantra - this has two parts. First, the reason for the question: since all deities arranged in a single Carya tantra mandala are not condensed into five families, as stated "In both Kriya and Carya tantras, the Buddha families are not condensed into five," therefore it appears necessary to explain the existence of separate tantras teaching the five families.

Second, one might doubt this contradicts what the previous masters and their predecessors taught, namely that while there are tantras teaching the Tathagata family like Vairocana Abhisambodhi and tantras teaching the Vajra family like Vajrapani Abhiseka, there are no tantras teaching the Padma family.

The actual response is that when it says "the five families are accomplished in Carya tantra," this refers to the existence of a mandala arrangement containing all five families complete. When it says "in Carya tantra, the Buddha families are not condensed into five," this refers to the terminology, colors and mudras not being explained as in the two higher yoga tantras, as stated "The mudras and colors are not taught there as in yoga tantra."

If asked where such a five-family accomplishment exists in Carya tantra, it is like the five victor families explained in the essential mandala taught in Vajrapani Abhiseka: Vairocana, Ratnasikhin, Sarvapuspita, Amitabha, and Aksobhya.

It is unreasonable to assert that the Sarvadurgatiparisodhana Tantra is explained as a Carya tantra according to the treatise authors' intent. Not only do no authoritative sources explain it as a Carya tantra, but the great venerable one accepted it as a Yoga tantra. Authoritative scholars explain that the five families' body colors being taught as all white accords with the tantra's explicit teaching.

The previous position's assertion of accepting it as Carya tantra is also incorrect, as there is no clear evidence that this was the previous position's assertion. The previous position is as stated: "The conventional [truth] of Carya tantra and the conventional [truth] of Yoga tantra appear as the five victorious ones." This contains no reason for accepting the Sarvadurgatiparisodhana as a Carya tantra.

These previous positions come from The Stages of View composed by the great translator Ka-ba Pal-tsek.
For the practice of Kriya, view the absolute truth, dharmatā.
For Samvṛti, view self-awareness qualities.
For the three types of maṇḍala appearances,
There is no delusion for beings, it is taught.
In both tantras it is maintained
View and conduct are in mutual accord.
In Yoga, in the pristine absolute,
The wisdom of dharmadhātu
Appears as deities through blessing realization.
Thus beings see it as delusory appearances.
In Mahāyoga, in absolute truth,
Non-dual self-awareness, suchness,
Through realizing the six magical manifestations and more,
Deity appearances are free from saṃsāra.
In Anuyoga, in absolute truth,
Seeking the family of great bliss realization,
The relative deity maṇḍala appears.
Thus beings are deluded by labeling.
Atiyoga is free from the two truths.
Everything self-arisen and self-appearing,
Wisdom free from the three extremes,
The two imputations are primordially absent.
Thus, like seeing gold as gold,
It is seeing truth exactly as it is.

After carefully examining these previous positions, one should analyze how faults arise from not distinguishing view and meditation.

The thirty-third question: "Regarding Jetāri's Amitāyus nine deities, which tantra's system is it? If the five families being yellow and smooth is unsuitable, then red and smooth would be difficult to establish."

Regarding this there are two parts. First, the reason for the question is that it was explained that the terminology of the five families does not occur in Kriyā and Caryā. Second, if this is so, is Ācārya Jetāri's system of nine Amitāyus deities explained according to Kriyā tantra or Yoga tantra? If the first, it contradicts the explanation that the five families terminology does not occur in those two. If the second, it contradicts explaining only the five families with colors and mudras that don't accord with what is taught in Yoga tantra. Similarly, in the Caryā tantra's Yamāntaka maṇḍala, the five families are explained as white and smooth, and the retinue are explained as having only concordant mudras. In the Hevajra Tantra, all fifteen Nairātmyā goddesses are explained as black and smooth, and these must also be divided into Vajra family, Ratna family and so forth.

The actual response: Regarding those named as the five families, while there is no inherent good or bad in their own nature, there are two ways of explaining those named as the five families in sūtras and tantras in accordance with the stages of disciples: One is establishing them as causal refuge as a branch for accumulating merit, in the manner of being other substantial entities than the disciple themselves. The other is applying them as basis of purification and purifier, establishing them as resultant refuge in the manner of what can arise in disciples' own mindstreams.

The latter is a special feature of the two higher yogas. Having conferred the five wisdom empowerments as the purifier for the five aggregates as basis of purification and the five afflictions as what is to be purified, based on making the path of the five approximate wisdoms into the result, the purified result of the five tathāgata families does not exist in Kriyā tantra. Although the meaning exists approximately in Caryā tantra, since the terminology does not exist, the root evidence for the meaning's existence depends on having the approximate five wisdom empowerments.

Although it is impossible for the five great families to have concordant colors and mudras like yellow-smooth etc. in the two higher tantras, for the minor families that are divided into five within each of them, and those that are distinct families but not determining factors, it is possible to have completely concordant colors and mudras, so there is no extreme fault.

The first way of establishing is not only in Kriyā tantra but also exists in sūtras. As taught in the Golden Light Sūtra: "Vulture Peak Mountain dharmadhātu, profound buddha domain" indicates central Vairocana. "Akṣobhya in the east, Ratnaketu in the south, Am
Through sound in the northern direction, as it is taught, and as extensively explained in many sutras, the pure land of Akshobhya exists in the east, and Amitabha's pure land exists in the west. In the Kriya Tantra, as cited above, the five families are clearly explained.

Thus, Jetari's nine deities of Amitayus are an exposition of the Amitayus Sutra in the manner of independent Kriya Tantra. Although the names of the five families are clearly mentioned therein, they are not the authentic five families capable of purifying the five aggregates as bases of purification. None of the nine are divisions of the Padma family which is one of the five great families. Rather, they are divisions from the single Amitabha of the three families of Kriya Tantra. They are subsumed into a single Padma family, and even that single one is not taught as a means of purifying the aggregate of perception as the basis of purification and desire as the object of purification through conferring the authentic awareness empowerment.

Although in Jetari's text the front-generation practice and method of empowerment are presented in the manner of independent Kriya Tantra, it should be carefully examined whether the explanation of generating oneself as a buddha is Jetari's own system or a covering of the higher tantras.

Here, others say that just as the terminology of the five families is clear in Kriya and Charya tantras, one must also take the five vows when receiving empowerment. This is incorrect. As stated in the Vajrasekhara: "For one who does not take vows, is very difficult to tame, lacks faith, only initiation should be given, but not all aspects." This explains that those who do not take the five family vows are not suitable to receive the vajra master empowerment. Then, wondering if they are also not suitable to receive the awareness empowerment, Master Anandagarbha taught: "All these empowerments from the flower garland empowerment up to the name empowerment are general empowerments for those who have and have not taken vows." This is because in Kriya and Charya tantras, nothing higher than the name empowerment is explained.

The thirty-fourth question asks: "If all conventional reality in Yoga Tantra is not taught as deities, how are the philosophical systems of Yoga Tantra and Cittamatra explained?" The reason for this question is based on the statement: "Therefore, in Yoga Tantra and below, appearances are not taught as deities. However, all conventional reality is just as it appears." This explains that the presentation of conventional reality accords with worldly conventions.

The fault of not asking would be that if one were to say: "In Highest Yoga Tantra too, conventional reality is not taught as deities. However, all conventional reality is just as it appears. Meditating on all appearances as deities is a special skillful means," this would be equivalent. In the precious master's General Presentation of Tantra Classes, the Cittamatrin view is divided into True and False Aspectarians. It explains that the True Aspectarian view accords with the Pratyekabuddha view, and corresponding to that is Yoga Tantra, while corresponding to the False Aspectarian view is Highest Yoga Tantra. What follows from this is that the True Aspectarian and Pratyekabuddha philosophical systems accept appearances as mind, as stated: "This is mind-only, there are no external objects" and "To abandon the conception of apprehended objects." That being the case, in Yoga Tantra one must accept self-appearances as deities, because one must accept appearances as mind and mind itself as deity. If one does not accept this, oneself is generated as a buddha and the wisdom beings of the resultant state are invited...
When inseparably dissolved, this gives rise to the doubt that this contradicts sealing. Regarding the actual response: For the yogis of the two higher yogas, in terms of the yogi's mind, there is a distinction between whether all appearances are deities or not, and whether conventional appearances are accepted as they appear. For the first-level yogi, after purifying impure appearances, when both container and contents are blessed as the nature of wisdom, although whatever arises must be accepted as the nature of deities, when not purified or when the seal is released, one must accept all dualistic appearances that arise as conventional appearances of just samaya and subject-object. For the yogi of Mahayoga, all appearances are eternally blessed as the nature of wisdom to be enjoyed, without any opportunity to revert to ordinary state after the wisdom beings depart. As evidence for this: Since all appearing and resounding phenomena have never existed from the very beginning, being free from all extremes of elaboration, there are no distinctions whatsoever in this, so it is called the natural dharmakaya, supreme primordial being, and vajra mind. Although there are no divisions in terms of essence, when connected with impure phenomena individually, dharmatā of form is designated as Vairocana, dharmatā of feeling as Ratnasambhava and so forth. When that dharmatā connects with body, speech and mind, it is established as the three vajras of body, speech and mind, up to the hundred families. Such naturally pure deities, when mixed with the wisdom wheel of adventitious purity, remain inseparable until space dissolves. The special quality of Mahayoga is that ordinary appearance is impossible. At that time, when all knowables are of one taste in dharmadhātu, this is called the purity of suchness. When connected with individual phenomena, designating with names of individual deities is called the purity of individual deities. The yogi's direct experience of this is called the purity of self-awareness. In brief, while for the first-level yogi's perspective, external appearances can sometimes be accepted as external objects, for the second-level yogi's perspective, it is utterly impossible for them to remain as such. This establishes the distinction between whether the two higher yogas accept conventional appearances as deities or not. When appearances are said to be deities in higher yoga, this refers to the perspective of meditation, not the philosophical view, as stated: "Visualizing as the three families and so forth as buddhas is meditation, not view." And "Not distinguishing between view and meditation, and not knowing method and wisdom, such divisions are mistaken." Understanding this, even saying "I am meditating as being Chakrasamvara" emphasizes the perspective of the meditating mind, because when entered with attachment, connection occurs without deception - like how conceptual cognition grasping a pot, when entered with attachment to the specifically characterized pot, can sometimes take the specifically characterized pot as its object. Claiming oneself to be Chakrasamvara is not for establishing philosophical tenets, as it is not established by scripture or reasoning, and the Vinaya states that unless such a claiming monk is just a proud fool, it constitutes the defeat of falsely claiming superhuman qualities. The thirty-fifth question: When divided into the hundred noble families, if conventional [appearances] are accepted as deities, from the Vajraśekhara Tantra the five families...
Each of the five small families, and each of these divided into four: essence, mudra and so forth - what is meant by the hundred families?

Regarding this, in the Mahayoga tantras it is said: "These conventional appearances, through the special skillful means, when substrate and that which purifies are introduced to each other, at that time the hundred noble families and other divisions were taught by the Victor."

When examining this scriptural passage, the division into hundred noble families is made in terms of introducing substrate and that which purifies. At that time, one must accept conventional appearances as deities.

As stated in Vajraśekhara Tantra: "How many kinds of families are there? The families are said to be one hundred, but when summarized there are five: Buddha, Vajra, Ratna, Karma and Dharma - these five types."

Although this is what the text directly teaches, this analysis does not serve as a refutation. In the Yoga tantras, after introducing substrate and that which purifies and dividing into hundred noble families, one cultivates only pure appearances after purifying with mantras like SVĀBHĀVA. When the seals are released and ordinary appearances arise, these appearances are not meditated upon as the hundred families.

In brief, the scriptural passage "at that time the hundred noble families" is not a universal coverage but is specifically connected with "from the Mahayoga tantras."

Regarding identifying the hundred noble families: From Hevajra: "The lord of mind is a single family." From the Extensive Division: "Families are said to be six types, also three types and five types." And: "In the collection of families there are many families, in those families there are one hundred families, in those there are hundreds of thousands of great families, in the divided families there are countless."

From Candraguhyatilaka: "The families are taught as one hundred, but when summarized there are five. Through connecting body, speech and mind, they also become three."

From Kālacakra: "The three families and the five families, single nature and hundred families."

The specific identification according to Caryāsamgraha: The five Tathāgata families, four mothers, Kṣitigarbha, Vajrapāṇi, Ākāśagarbha, Lokeśvara, and Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣkambhin - these five bodhisattvas; from Rūpavajrī to Spraṣṭavyavajrī - these five goddesses. Each of these nineteen divided into five makes ninety-five. The five wisdoms that commonly bless all these make one hundred.

The way these are divided into fives: For form as substrate: shape, appearance, color, manifestation, and mere self-awareness - these five. For feeling: feelings arising from combination, bile, phlegm, wind, and the three feelings of pleasure, pain and neutrality - these five. For perception: perception of bipeds, quadrupeds, those without legs, those with many legs, and unchanging perception - these five. For formations: formations of body, speech and mind, one for the three realms, and formations of liberation - these five. For consciousness: the five from eye consciousness through body consciousness. For earth element: hair, bones and so forth.
The collections of flesh, collections of hair and nails, collections of teeth and skin, collections of sinews and ribs, collections of impurities and intestines - these five, or alternatively the four continents and Mount Meru make five.

For the water purification base: phlegm and such, urine, sweat, blood, and saliva make five.

For the fire purification base: heart, head, navel, all limbs, and digestive heat make five types.

For wind: life-holding, pervasive, downward-moving, upward-moving, and equalizing.

For the earth element's purification base in the eye: eye faculty, white eyeball, corner of eye, immovable part, and apprehension of three forms make five.

For the ear: ear faculty, apprehension of three sounds, ear hole, ear root, and ear nature.

For the nose purification base: nose faculty, inner center, apprehension of three smells, nostrils, and nose nature.

For tongue: tongue faculty, root, tip, apprehension of three tastes, and tongue nature.

For body: body faculty, bones, flesh, skin, and apprehension of three tactile sensations.

For the Vajra Lady's purification base of form: form objects, graceful playful forms, desirous forms, pleasant/unpleasant/neutral forms, and function-accomplishing forms.

For sound: inner ear sounds, river and such sounds, tongue and palate sounds, forest and drum and such sounds, and primordial peaceful and wrathful HŪṂ sounds.

For smell: general smells, limb smells, three types of distinct smells, taste smells, and inexhaustible smells.

For taste: sweet, bitter, salty, hot-sour, and astringent.

For touch: single-seat touch, embracing touch, kissing touch, sucking touch, and union of two organs touch.

According to the Kālacakra: the five aggregates, eighteen elements, twelve skull segments, thirty-two teeth, twenty nails - through categorizing one hundred purification bases make one hundred families. 

How do the hundred purification bases become the hundred supreme families? Each of the five aggregates is divided threefold into the imagined, the conceptualized, and the real nature.

The actual purification base is conceptualized form. The basis of characteristics is consciousness appearing as form aggregate. What is to be purified is imagined form - the duality of subject and object. The purifier has three divisions of ground, path and result, all of which are designated states of the real nature of form. When connected with individual phenomena at the time of the ground, it is called the hundred supreme families of the ground phase. At the time of final transformation, it is called the hundred supreme families of the result phase. At that time, since the individual conventional phenomena are purified, there is no division into hundred supreme families from the perspective of phenomena. Through divisions of gathering into three kāyas, five kāyas, or single dharmakāya, they become three, five or one family. These three stages are respectively called causal tantra, method tantra, and resultant tantra.

These meanings are taught in Hevajra: "The purity of all things is declared to be suchness. Then through individual divisions, the deities should be explained. The five aggregates, six faculties, six sense fields, and five great elements are naturally pure. The obscurations of afflictions and knowables are to be purified." This teaches the purification bases, what is to be purified, and the causes that can purify. As for the purifier, it is stated: "Self-aware nature itself is pure, purified by other purity..."
Thus it was said, "No." Continuing from that same passage: "O Blessed One, what is impure?" The Buddha replied, "Form and so forth. Why? Because of the existence of the grasped and grasper." When examining the meaning of these, the five impure aggregates are not to be meditated upon as supreme, because they arise through the power of ignorance and are conventional truth. Since the deity is established from the wisdom of dharmadhātu, it must be established as ultimate truth in terms of the way things really are. Therefore, the imagined grasped is not accepted even conventionally by the Cittamātrins, and the imagined grasper is not accepted as conventionally existent even by the Vijñaptimātrins, so what need to mention the Niḥsvabhāvavādins? 

Therefore, the appearing aspect of these impure conventional appearances is not accepted as existent, while their essence abides as the supreme deity itself. This is the provisional philosophical tenet of the practitioners of the Unsurpassed Yoga tantra. Finally, if one accepts that the essence of dharmatā abides as the supreme deity itself, because one has not gone beyond the conceptual fixation on the magnificent deity, it is empty of inherent nature.

This philosophical tenet itself is also a post-meditation tenet that depends on the state of cultivating the two stages in sequence during meditative equipoise. In post-meditation of the first stage, having purified impure appearances, one engages in what is to be adopted and abandoned while abiding in divine pride. In post-meditation of the second stage's actual wisdom, all elaborated characteristics are eliminated.

Regarding these, it is said:
Without properly studying the texts of Maitreya and the brother Asaṅga,
Who can understand the definitive meaning of purifying
All impure appearances through the generation stage
Of the unsurpassed vehicle?
Without properly reading the Nāgārjuna tradition's
Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika systems' rational explanations,
Who can understand the nature of the dharmakāya
Free from the elaborations of completion stage wisdom?
When the conventional truth-affirming subject sees
All appearances as they appear in worldly convention
As the essence of the hundred noble families,
Is there valid cognition that is non-contradictory and unerring?
The conventional appearances being absent in their own place,
Seeing whatever appears as the essence of deity forms,
And the non-dual wisdom of the assembly of supreme deities
Creating these - these all come down to the same point.
Those yogis of the two stages who don't understand this
Through the noose of teaching phenomena as having characteristics
Bind themselves and countless faithful followers
Hundreds of times - are there not some who do this?
Without looking at what's explained as the basis for purification in the causal tantra,
Without reading the reasoning for not abandoning the ground,
To those who say there's no distinction between basis of purification and what's to be purified,
I say - examine whether you're fulfilling the intent of the predecessors!

The thirty-sixth question states:
If the practice of the four classes of tantra
Is done mistakenly, it will be far off.
Even if one practices according to Kriyā and Yoga tantras,
Or according to Unexcelled tantra,
Will accomplishments be distant?
If so, what about what was done
By Nāgārjuna and Noble Tārā?
How should practitioners of the supreme vehicle
Perform Kriyā tantra rituals?

Regarding this, there are two parts. First, the reason for asking is, as stated:
"Even if the practice of the four tantras
Is mistaken, accomplishments are far off.
Making offerings to painted images and praying,
Having self-generation and sādhana practice,
Following the Yoga tantra,
This was done according to that system."
The reason appears to be the apparent contradiction between these earlier and later statements.

Second, the fault of not asking would be: Then it would follow that accomplishments would be distant even if one practiced according to Kriyā and Yoga tantras, and it would follow that accomplishments would be distant even if one practiced according to Unexcelled tantra, and it would follow that practitioners of Yoga and Unexcelled tantra would not know how to
At that time, since there is both self-generation as a buddha and the insertion of the wisdom wheel, one cannot accept all three of these. The rituals taught in the Yoga Tantra can be applied to both Kriya and Carya, as stated by Acharya Anandagarbha. As stated in the Alokamahātantra: "All those who are strongly attached to the rituals of Kriya, Carya, and both types of tantras should accomplish the mahāmudrā and so forth explained in these rituals." This contradicts both that scriptural authority and the logic that practitioners of Kriya Tantra cannot accomplish supreme siddhis without relying on the higher tantric classes.

The basis for interpreting Kriya Tantra like Yoga Tantra exists in the commentary on chapter seven of the Vairocana Magical Net by Acharya Anandagarbha, as stated by the lord guru. Moreover, the interpretation of Kriya Tantra as Carya Tantra was composed by Acharya Buddhaguhya in his commentary on the Later Meditation. And regarding the interpretation of Kriya Tantra as Highest Yoga Tantra: Noble Nagarjuna composed a sadhana of Thousand-Armed Thousand-Eyed Avalokiteshvara, Bhikshuni Shrimati composed a sadhana of Eleven-Faced Avalokiteshvara, and Acharya Candragomin composed sadhanas of Sitatapatra. Also Shantipa and Jetari composed sadhanas of the Five Families, and Lord Atisha composed sadhanas of Ushnisha Vimala. In the Ocean of Sadhanas, the Two Hundred and Fifty, and the Hundred Sadhanas, Kriya Tantra is explained like Highest Yoga Tantra.

Thus Nagarjuna first generates Avalokiteshvara with retinue through three rituals, then invites the wisdom beings, performs the empowerment, and seals with the family lord. After that he explains the practice of completion stage. Such doubts may arise.

Second, giving the actual response has two parts: the main point and related topics. First, the classification into four tantra classes is not based on qualitative differences in the deity to be accomplished as explained in the various tantras, because that would entail that they are not all complete buddhas. Rather, the classification is based on methods of accomplishment and ritual approaches, arranged according to the sequence of disciples' sharp or dull faculties. As stated in the Guhyasamaja: "Kriya Tantra for the inferior, Carya Tantra for those above that, Yoga Tantra for supreme beings, and above that Highest Yoga Tantra."

Therefore, tantric disciples who must accomplish supreme siddhis through Kriya Tantra rituals alone remain far from supreme siddhis even if they practice with methods from any of the three higher tantra classes, because they are not suitable vessels for such practice. It is like a traveler who must take the land route - even if they go by fast river route, they will not reach their destination easily. Thus the first analysis does no harm.

Then what is the purpose of interpreting Kriya Tantra like Highest Yoga Tantra? This does not mean accepting common ground between Kriya Tantra sadhanas and Highest Yoga Tantra sadhanas. Rather, it means applying the two stages of the path according to Highest Yoga Tantra to a deity from Kriya Tantra, like Thousand-Armed Thousand-Eyed Avalokiteshvara. This is not intended for disciples of Kriya Tantra to practice, but rather is meant for disciples of Highest Yoga Tantra as a method for accomplishing special deities taught in Kriya Tantra.

When explained this way, the terminology of "interpreting Kriya Tantra like Highest Yoga Tantra" and so forth is somewhat problematic. The deities taught in Kriya Tantra...
It is appropriate to use such terminology as "practicing according to the sadhana that comes from the Anuttara [tantras]," since there cannot be a common basis between the sadhanas for achieving the supreme accomplishments of each of the four classes of tantra. Thus, the second analysis also does not contradict this.

Regarding how the third analysis does not contradict: For supreme yogis of the highest vehicle, there is no purpose in practicing kriya tantra sadhanas to achieve the supreme accomplishment, because when superior methods exist, there is no need to rely on inferior ones. Even kriya tantra practitioners must ultimately rely on the highest [tantras] to achieve the supreme accomplishment.

Regarding the second point: There is evidence that self-generation does not exist in kriya tantra practice, and the proof of its existence is inconclusive. 

On the first point: Although there is visualization of the deity in front, there is no self-generation as the deity. As stated in the Jñānavajrasamuccaya tantra: "Those who practice while contemplating fear, maintaining extreme purity, lacking the supreme bliss of the jñānasattva, without pride of being the deity oneself, not being a domain of the extraordinary, and being cut off by conceptual thoughts that are causes of faults - they abide in kriya tantra." Additionally, none of the six classes of kriya tantra scriptures contain explanations of self-generation.

On the second point: Later Tibetan scholars say that self-generation exists in kriya tantra proper, as explained by Ācārya Buddhaguhya in his commentary on the Dhyānottara, where he comments on the root text's statement "Absorbed in sound, mind and basis": "Sound refers to mantra syllables. Mind refers to becoming the form of the moon disk of mantra. Basis refers to the nature of the Tathāgata's form. The second basis is one's own deity form." They claim "one's own deity" must refer to self-generation, since it has the same meaning as what is explained in the Vairocana Abhisaṃbodhi: "The letter is bodhicitta, sound is called the second, basis is establishing one's own deity, to be done with one's own body. The second basis refers to the supreme two-legged perfect buddha."

This is incorrect due to the proof being inconclusive and there being refuting evidence. First, the pervasion is uncertain because Ācārya Buddhaguhya combined kriya and carya into a single class of tantra. He cited carya tantra passages as evidence for self-generation existing in kriya practices. The two bases explained in the Dhyānottara and the two bases in the Abhisaṃbodhi need not be interpreted as having the same meaning, since the different levels of tantra must be distinguished. "One's own deity form" should be explained as referring to a painted image of one's personal deity or the wisdom being invited to the second basis.

The refuting evidence consists of contradictions with both scripture and reasoning. Regarding scripture: If self-generation were present in all supreme deity sadhanas of kriya tantra because the meditation explained in the Dhyānottara is definitely necessary when reciting mantras, this would contradict what Ācārya Bodhicārya, whom you accept as authoritative, states in his General Kriya Sadhana: "One should not think that the yoga of deity practice is not taught in kriya tantra. Although the Blessed One mostly did not teach it, it is primarily taught in the Vajrapāṇi Abhiṣeka and Entering the Ten Realities." This does not refute our position since this also follows the system that combines kriya and carya, and "yoga of deity practice" is not necessarily restricted to self-generation alone.

The contradiction with reasoning is...
There is no difference in the deity practices, as both involve self-generation as the deity and the insertion of wisdom beings, since both appear similarly. Other distinctions have not been differentiated by authorities or by yourself, so this much elaboration will suffice.

The thirty-seventh question asks: "In which tantric text is it explained about the thirty-seven great outer places? If one accepts just Jambudvipa as a great place, wouldn't undesirable consequences arise for oneself?" This has two parts: the reason for asking and the fault of not asking.

First, in the tantras and authoritative texts, the explanation of the thirty-seven places is not clearly presented. However, in this treatise it states: "One travels to practice awareness in the thirty-seven great places." This explains that there are thirty-seven outer places where one must travel for the purpose of practices.

Due to the lack of clear explanation of what these thirty-seven are by the commentators of this treatise, [various interpretations exist]. Lhatsun's commentary explains that adding the four continents and their combination as one to the thirty-two mentioned in the Hevajra root tantra makes thirty-seven, as explained by the great master in Indrabhuti's Path Series. Although they cannot be counted individually in the external world, this appears to correspond to thirty-seven when correlated with inner purity.

Poshangpa explains: "The thirty-seven great places are the thirty-two clearly stated in the tantra plus the four continents and Mount Meru, making thirty-seven according to the previous masters' words."

Gandongpa explains: "The twenty-four places mentioned in Chakrasamvara, plus the four directions and center of the inner ring of the eight-petaled lotus at the heart center, plus the eight intermediate directions of the outer ring make thirty-seven places. Just as there are thirty-seven places internally, externally there are also thirty-seven like Charitra and so forth. This corresponds to what is said in the 'Petition to the Buddhas of the Ten Directions': 'From Uddiyana and Jalandhara...' to 'The regions in the south and west were previously the foundation of your teaching.'"

Kumara's commentary explains that these places mentioned in the Hevajra Tantra such as "The place is explained as Jalandhara" correspond to the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment and the thirty-seven channels that exist externally in Jambudvipa and internally from the crown to the soles of the feet.

Second, regarding the fault of not asking: The first system is untenable because if the thirty-seven places do not exist externally, it contradicts this treatise's root text. Also, it contradicts your own cited passage that states the four continents are considered great places according to the venerable master's system.

The second system is also unreasonable because the thirty-seven outer places cannot be individually counted, and the term "hidden channels in the body" does not fit the literal meaning, as "hidden" should refer to what is not clearly taught in the tantra rather than what is hidden in the body - this is not an authoritative interpretation.

The third system is impossible because even if there are twelve sacred places externally corresponding to the twelve channels at the heart internally, citing the "Petition" text as evidence is irrelevant, as that text identifies places where the teaching previously arose rather than places where heroes and yoginis gather. Moreover, that text also counts places like Hor, Greater Hor, China, and Greater China.

The fourth system is also not good because the thirty-seven great places are not complete in the Hevajra Tantra.
[Without being counted in between] Since it cannot be counted, and since what should be added on top of that is not clearly explained, the thirty-seven cannot be identified. According to these four systems, if the four continents are accepted as great places, this does not accord with this treatise's own system. Here, until one has achieved stability in the two stages, one meditates in one's own home. Then, when the time comes to engage in the yogic conduct, it is taught that one should travel to the great places. If the initial place where one meditates is itself a great place, going elsewhere would be meaningless. And even if there were meaning, since wherever one goes one must accept it as being within the great places, there would be no need to specify Oddiyana and so forth. If all of Jambudvipa is a great place, is all of Jambudvipa accepted as such, or just specific locations? If the former, this contradicts all tantric texts. If the latter...

The thirty-two specific great places like Oddiyana - are they just these or are there others not included among them? If the former, it does not help in counting the thirty-seven. If the latter, it would be reasonable to identify those places and count them, but not reasonable to derive them merely from categories. Furthermore, although the Kālacakra tantra and commentaries explain all four continents as places, this does not help here because that context concerns dividing the four cardinal and intermediate directions of all four maṇḍala supports, explaining forty-eight divisions of places and so forth. This refers to the four-hundred-thousand world-systems correlated with the body measuring one fathom square, connecting inner and outer, rather than places for practicing conduct. These objections will arise.

Second, giving the actual response has two parts: establishing the enumeration of the thirty-seven places and extensively explaining their sources. The first has three parts: how they are taught in Hevajra, how they are taught in Cakrasaṃvara, and how they are taught in Kālacakra. The first has three parts: explaining the twelve types of grounds, explaining the thirty-two manifest divisions, and supplementing these to arrive at thirty-seven. First: As stated: "Hey Bhagavan! How many gathering places are there?" The Bhagavan replied: "Places and near-places, fields and near-fields, burial grounds and near-burial grounds, likewise gatherings and near-gatherings, drinking places and near-drinking places, charnel grounds and near-charnel grounds - these twelve grounds are the lord of the ten grounds himself. This should not be spoken by others."

What does this teach? The ten grounds called Joyful and so forth explained in the Pāramitāyāna are here taught by designating them with names like "places" and so forth. As stated in the Saṃpuṭa: "The ten pāramitā grounds are designated in yoginī barbarian terms like 'pu' and so forth. Consider this in both outer and inner ways."

The correlation of specific grounds is taught in the same text: "Place is the Joyful ground, likewise near-place is Stainless, field should be known as Luminous, near-field is Radiant, burial ground is Difficult to Overcome, near-burial ground is Hard to Practice, gathering is Far Advanced, near-gathering is Immovable, charnel ground is Good Intelligence, near-charnel ground is Cloud of Dharma." While it is unclear which two drinking places correlate with which grounds, although the Mantrānusāriṇī commentary explains they correlate with the grounds of Devoted Conduct and All-Illuminating, from the extensive tantra citation in the Kumuda it is clear they must correlate with the grounds of Exemplary and Great Wisdom.
Thus it was taught by the previous masters. Regarding the meaning of connecting those places and those grounds, according to the words of Dharma Lord Pandita in his commentary on the Nairātmyā Stuti: "Externally there are twenty-four places including the primary places (gnas) and secondary places (nye ba'i gnas). Although their essence is Buddha, they appear in the form of dakas and dakinis who have attained the first and other grounds. Similarly, the twenty-four places also exist within one's own body, and when the winds and bodhicitta that correspond to the dakas and dakinis dissolve into the central channel, realization arises and the external dakas and dakinis become one's companions."

Second, regarding the detailed enumeration, as stated: "O Blessed One, what are the places and so forth?" The Blessed One replied: "The primary place is explained as Jālandhara, likewise Oḍḍiyāna, Kollagiri is a place, and likewise Kāmarūpa. The secondary place is called Mālava, and Sindhu Nagara. The field is explained as Munmuni, the field is Pretapuri. Just like Devīkoṭa is a field, the field is Caṇḍapuri. The secondary field is called Kuluta, likewise Arbuta. Mount Kailāsa of supreme offering to cows is explained as a condensed secondary field. Candoha, Kekala, Born in Salt Ocean, Lampāka and Kañci, likewise Saurāṣṭra. The near Candoha is Kaliṅga, the Golden Isle, and Koṅkana is also near Candoha - these are explained in brief. The city of consumption and the edge of consumption village, Caritrā and Kosala, the city of young Vaindā. Great Compassionate Vajra Heart, that consumption is near. The charnel ground of complete virtue and the charnel ground at ocean's shore. The garden pond enclosure's edge is explained as the near charnel ground."

Third, thus to the thirty-two explicitly taught, five must be added to make thirty-seven places. Some say these are the four continents and Mount Meru, but this is incorrect because it is not taught in either Samvara or Hevajra and lacks scriptural authority. Although the Kālacakra and Rishyavali Tantra explain the four continents as places, Mount Meru is not explained as a place. Even though the four continents are explained as places, explaining them as supplements to the thirty-two to make thirty-seven is not the meaning of those tantras, as is clear in their respective texts. Although the Noble One explains the four continents as supplements to make thirty-seven in Indrabhūti's Path Series, whether this refers to external or internal must be determined, and scriptural sources for the definite number must be sought. It can never fit with the enumeration of thirty-seven explained here, because if a yogi of Jambudvīpa had to travel to Uttarakuru and the other continents in order to traverse the internal grounds and paths, that would be too absurd.

Some say the four channel petals inside the dharma wheel at the heart chakra are implicitly taught as the places of consumption and near-consumption, and including the central place at the heart makes five, perfectly explaining the thirty-seven great places. This too is incorrect, because merely identifying five hidden channels cannot fulfill one's intention of identifying five external great places. If one intends the five external places corresponding to the five hidden channels, those very places must be identified. The explanation of the four continents as any kind of places does not exist in either Samvara or Hevajra. When that is absent, it follows that the four continents cannot serve as supplements to the thirty-seven places, because the thirty-seven places must be connected as equivalent to the thirteen grounds. At that time, the disciple...
From among the twelve stages, whichever it may be, it is covered by whichever of the twelve places and so forth. Therefore, according to our own system, there are the two basic divisions of assembly and near-assembly, each having two subdivisions making four, and the outer place of no-more-learning which is either Vajrāsana or Akaniṣṭha, making thirty-seven in total.

As evidence that this is the proper enumeration, when explaining the division of families above, all twelve including assembly and near-assembly were explained. Later when explaining the subdivisions, all thirty-two were explained as subdivisions of just the remaining ten, not explicitly explaining the subdivisions of those two. If the subdivisions of those two were not explained, the twelve learner stages would not be complete, as just cited in the Sampuṭa scripture.

If one asks what are the four subdivisions of the two assemblies, according to the Mahāmudrā Tilaka: Assembly has Karmarūpaṭaka and Suvarṇadvīpa; near-assembly has Koṅkana and Bhṛkuṭi, making four. According to Cakrasaṃvara: Assembly has Pretapuri and Gṛhadeva; near-assembly has Saurāṣṭra and Suvarṇadvīpa, making four. Although some names among these four supplementary places are already explained within the thirty-two, this is not redundant. Since these subdivisions are separate basic categories, though the names are similar, they must be applied to different meanings and places.

Thus, adding to the thirty-two places explicitly taught in Hevajra Tantra the four subdivisions of the two assemblies and the place of enlightenment makes five, bringing the outer places to thirty-seven. Alternatively, to the thirty-two places explicitly taught in Hevajra, add five places taught in Cakrasaṃvara but not explained there, making thirty-seven. What are these five? They are Raśmiśvara, Oḍre, Triśakuni, Pretapuri, and Gṛhadeva. When explained this way, there are thirty-seven learner places alone.

Secondly, according to the Cakrasaṃvara system, everyone agrees that from the basic twelve categories starting with "place," twenty-four subdivisions are enumerated. As for how these are supplemented to make thirty-seven divisions, this will be explained from three different perspectives.

First, the twenty-four subdivisions are: Pulliramālaya meaning "expanded mountain," Jālandhara meaning either "holder of nets" or "holder of flames" according to different interpretations of "jva" and "jā," Oḍḍiyāna, Arbuta meaning "worthy of offerings," Godāvari meaning "supreme gift of cows," Rāmeśvara meaning "lord of joy," Devīkoṭa meaning "fortress of the goddess," Mālava meaning "having garlands," Kāmarūpa meaning "form of desire," Oḍre meaning "playful," Triśakuni meaning "three auspicious signs," Kosala meaning "treasury keeper" or "virtuous," Kaliṅga meaning "sign of speech," Lampāka meaning "hanging" or "head-ornament," Kāñcika meaning "sour," Himālaya meaning "snow-possessor," Pretapuri meaning "city of hungry ghosts," Gṛhadeva meaning "house deity," Saurāṣṭra meaning "good country" or "great city," Suvarṇadvīpa meaning "golden," Nāgara meaning "city" (or according to those who explain Pāṭaliputra and Nāgara as synonymous, meaning "city of the pale son"). Some explain Sindhura as keeping the Sanskrit as is. Maru means "desert plain" or "waterless land." Kuluta means "possessing lineage." Thus adding the twelve basic divisions to these twenty-four subdivisions makes thirty-six...
The thirty-seven sacred places for awakening are explained in two enumerations. The first is the twenty-four places taught in Chakrasamvara, supplemented by thirteen places taught in Hevajra. These are:

From the Earth category: Mumnir and Bedapura and Chagspura.

From the Tandoha category: Harikela and Gyatso Nangkye.

From the Near-Tandoha category: Kongkana.

From the Carya category: Grongi Thar, Charita, Binda, and Zhonnu's City.

From the Charnel Ground category: Rabson, Gyatso'i Gram, and Kyetshal Rawa'i Dzingbu'i Gram.

Thus there are thirty-seven outer sacred places for the level of training. The third enumeration adds to the twenty-four places the five deities of the Great Bliss Wheel and eight directional guardians, making thirteen outer places. Among these thirteen, the places of the retinue goddesses correspond to the training levels. These must be explained in terms of the two categories of Charya and Near-Charya, since the division of the two Charyas is not shown within the twenty-four places previously explained, and without showing this the twelve would be incomplete. These correspond to the two hidden grounds in the Paramitayana and the five channels hidden in the tantra.

When asked where the twelve outer places corresponding to the twelve retinue goddesses are explained: The eight directional guardians' places are the eight great charnel grounds. The four retinue goddesses of the Great Bliss Wheel reside in the four places of Ishvara's consorts: the northeast of Mount Meru, the center, Paranirmitavashavartin, and Vajrasana, as explained in the Vajradaka commentary and others.

If asked why the eight directional guardians and four mothers do not unite with the heroes: The eight conceal the fathers in the form of faces and figures, while the five essential yoginis share the single father, the Blessed One, as the ancient masters explain.

As stated in the Vajradaka: "Now I shall explain what is hidden in the tantra. Listen, practitioners, to the condensed ritual. From the guru places of Chakrasamvara and so forth, all are pervaded by dakinis. The wisdom-holders' birthplaces manifest in various regions. These are called dakinis, the main ones of the vajra mandala. The six yoginis are explained to practitioners in symbolic language. In the lands of Kuluta and Maru dwell the matrikas..." up to "The maidens of these lands, inseparable from the heroes, all having forms of desire..."

This shows the places of the yoginis who unite with the heroes. Immediately after, the places of the outer yoginis are established through questions and answers. As stated there: "Then the goddess, having made offerings and prostrations to the Blessed One, again asked: 'The distinctions of dakinis and the great destructive earth-protectors - their names, the names of their lands, and the distinctions of their places - hearing which practitioners will accomplish without doubt - please explain all these in brief, O Lord.'" The extensive reply teaches how to understand the places of the eight directional guardians and four goddesses of Great Bliss. For details, one should look there.

From the Ocean of Dakinis: "The non-non-existent goddess, she who relies on the state of non-duality, thirty..."
The seven forms arise in the center from one's own mantra, as it is taught. Furthermore, the sixty-four goddesses residing in the navel chakra of emanation have sixty-four outer locations, as taught: "The central region goddess, the Kalinga goddess," and so forth to "the charnel ground goddess and near charnel ground goddess, the great ocean shore goddess, the barbarian land goddess, and the all-regions goddess - thus sequentially are the sixty-four goddesses."

This explanation also establishes the four great bliss goddesses and the distinct outer regions of the eight directional gates. Although the outer regions are definitively enumerated as thirty-seven, this is due to inner certainty.

The third, regarding what is taught in the Kalachakra, has two parts: the twelve bases of division such as places established in the four hundred thousand world realms, and the thirty-seven divisions not fixed to any particular location.

First, as taught in the tantra: "In all directions of glorious Mount Meru, reaching the earth mandala are the places and near-places." The great commentary Vimala Prabha explains: The places in the four directions are of wind, fire, water and earth nature - Purvavideha in the east, Small Jambudvipa, Uttarakuru in the north, and Godaniya in the west. The near-places are of that same nature in the intermediate directions - fire and without truth.

This distinction does not change anywhere. The thirty-six lineages of yoginis can reside in a single city. Since this is supreme and pervades all buddhas, the places and so forth exist in Tibet, China and other regions. This is not taught in other condensed tantras.  

The places and so forth taught in all regions and all cities are: The places are the homes of Tara and others, being four types. Similarly, the homes of Vajrashabda and others are six types. The homes of Carcika and others are the eight types of sandoha. The homes of Mohani and others are the ten types of assembly. The homes of Shvamukhi and others are the eight types of charnel grounds.

As it is said: "Although in the brief teaching on the divisions of regions in Hevajra two assemblies were explained, since extensive explanation did not occur, adding four divisions to the two assemblies makes thirty-six places of training and one place of no-training, making thirty-seven. Or the thirty-seven can be made by mutually supplementing Samvara and Hevajra. In Hevajra thirty-two are taught, in Chakrasamvara twenty-four. Within the twenty-four, there are five not explained in Hevajra. Within the thirty-two, there are thirteen not explained in Samvara. Among the nineteen that correspond, by teaching two cities with the single name Nagara, the thirty-seven great regions are established. Or to the twenty-four great regions, adding the twelve bases of division like places makes thirty-six places of training and one place of no-training, equaling thirty-seven. The textual proof for this is that places, near-places and so forth are clearly taught as thirty-seven great regions.

In Kalachakra, after explaining the twelve places and so forth as complete in the outer and inner four-cubit body of four hundred thousand parts, what is taught in other classes of tantra about Jalandhara and other divisions existing in separate regions is provisional meaning for children. In one region are complete the thirty-six types of yogini lineages. Where all are complete, the thirty-six great regions are complete. Where the all-pervading lord Kalachakra abides, that place and thirty-seven clearly taught.
Alternatively, according to the Chakrasamvara Tantra, regarding the thirty-seven yoginis, their definite number is explained and their locations, both external and internal, are thirty-seven.

As for the evidence for these, the establishment of thirty-seven external and internal places is based on the three aspects: the basis to be purified, the means of purification, and the result of purification, each having thirty-seven elements.

Thus the previous masters have taught. As for how this is so: First, what is to be purified in samsara includes: the five aggregates, five elements, six external objects, six internal sense fields, two shoulders, two forearms, mouth, private parts, two knees, crown, two soles - making ten, and five afflictions, totaling thirty-seven.

Regarding the means of purification on the path, there are two: the paramita path and the unique tantric path. The first consists of the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment. The second has two aspects related to the generation and completion stages.

The first of these has two parts concerning the support (the mandala palace) and the supported (the deities). The first, according to the Sarvarahasya Tantra which states "The four foundations of mindfulness are called the entrance," correlates the qualities of the palace with the thirty-seven factors of the northern direction.

The second consists of: five buddha families, five consorts, Moha-vajri and others, two sets of six including Rupa-vajri and others, ten wrathful ones, and five manifest enlightenment factors, totaling thirty-seven.

Regarding the completion stage, there are two aspects: concerning the four support mandalas and concerning the supported wisdom. The first includes: thirty-two explicitly taught channels plus five hidden channels making thirty-seven; twenty-four letters (like PUDZA, etc.) plus eight long HŪṂs plus BAṂ, AṂ, DZIṂ, KHAṂ, HŪṂ making thirty-seven letters; thirty-seven nectars dwelling within these; and the winds controlling these - thirty-seven essence wisdom wind mandalas.

The second consists of thirty-seven exemplifying wisdoms arising in dependence on these supports, and thirty-seven ultimate wisdoms being exemplified.

Third, the results of purification at buddhahood are: five aspects of body, speech, mind, qualities and activities; four immeasurables; five liberating wisdoms; six superknowledges; six uncontaminated objects; ten powers; and five wisdoms, totaling thirty-seven. This appears in the Commentary of Sunlight composed by the holy master.

The thirty-eighth question states that if Mapham is not Manasarovar, then the Ganges would not be itself - this requires a response. This has two parts: First, the reason for the question is that in this text it states "The Snow Mountain is not Mount Kailash, Manasarovar is not Lake Mapham." Some earlier opponents argued: "Since the Ganges flows from here, why tire oneself searching for Manasarovar? Due to impermanence, it does not remain as before." Most commentators did not answer this objection. Lhatsun Samyas said: "By what valid cognition is it proven that it flows from there? Are they foolish Tibetans wandering like dogs for wealth, or what else could they be but foolish ācaryas? Relying merely on such words to refute the speech of great panditas is laughable." This much was said, but it was insufficient to defeat that opponent.

Second, the fault of not asking: This text states "Therefore, without miraculous powers one cannot go to the Snow Mountain" and "It is said one cannot travel there without miraculous powers." The great master Ralgri and others explain that as stated in "Beyond nine black mountains to the north are the snow mountains," this must refer to Mount Kailash itself, and Manasarovar must refer to Lake Mapham itself. Because Nyen Yod and...
Mount Kailash's north and south sides are equal in height, as confirmed by the measurements of those who have been there. The Ganges flows from Lake Manasarovar, as verified by those who have traveled there. While the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya states that Gangasacan is difficult to reach for those without supernatural powers, it does not say it is impossible to reach.

If it were impossible, the whole of Jambudvīpa would be nonexistent. If people from smaller continents can reach there, what reason is there that those from Jambudvīpa cannot? If one argues it's due to fierce yakṣas, deep ravines, and great rivers blocking the way, such impassable places do not exist even at the ocean's edge in Jambudvīpa.

Those who say it doesn't match the characteristics described in the Mahāvastu and Prajñapti are making an argument that could equally apply to Gṛdhrakūṭa mountain, Śītavana, Vaiśālī, Śrāvastī and other great cities, as these places described in the sūtras no longer exist today. The claim that one account is poetic license while the other describes reality is also untenable, as there is no basis for such a distinction.

To properly refute these views, there are two approaches: addressing individual objections and establishing the definitive system of the Ganges River. For the first, there are five points. Regarding the first objection: The reasoning is mistaken and there are counter-arguments.

The mere fact that there are snow mountains north of Śrāvastī does not establish it as the Himalayas described in the Prajñapti, as this would lead to absurd consequences. Those who have been there confirm that the nine black mountains extending north from Śrāvastī to Kailash do not exist. Some commentators of the Abhidharma, trying to resolve this issue, had to resort to claiming the nine black mountains look like "three groups of three singers."

The second point involves scriptural inconsistency and logical problems. The phrase "from this Śrāvastī" is not the literal meaning, as it contradicts the auto-commentary. Rather, the auto-commentary explains "in this northern direction beyond nine black mountains," meaning they exist in the northern region of this Jambudvīpa.

Your position contradicts direct perception, as the arrangement of Mount Gandhamādana and the snow lakes differs from scriptural descriptions. The Prajñapti describes the Ganges flowing eastward from an elephant's mouth, while your claimed Ganges visibly flows westward from Lake Manasarovar.

Regarding the second objection's response: If it's directly perceived that the Ganges, one of the four great rivers, flows from Manasarovar, then the Sindhu, Sītā, and Pakṣu should also be seen flowing from there. If you claim this pervasion is uncertain, what evidence supports your original pervasion? If you say scripture states the lake from which the Ganges flows is Anavatapta, then scripture also states the Sindhu and others flow from that same lake.

The river called Ganges that flows from Manasarovar is not actually the Ganges that is counted among the four rivers, as the other three rivers are not observed flowing from the same lake. If changing times caused the other three rivers to no longer flow from Manasarovar, the Ganges should also not flow from there now, and there is no trace of channels where the other three rivers could have flowed in the past.

For the third objection's response: It is not definitively established by reasoning and is contradicted by scripture. First, by this logic, even Śambhala in the north would not exist in Jambudvīpa, as it lies beyond Āryadeśa.
The translation of the passage discusses the rivers and geographical features of ancient India, particularly relating to the Ganges River and Lake Anavatapta. Here is my complete translation:

Since ordinary beings lack supernatural powers, they cannot travel there. Secondly, from the medical scriptures: "From there, four rivers flow in the four directions into the poisonous oceans: the Ganges, Sindhu, Pakṣu, and Sita. Except for those who have attained supernatural powers, humans cannot travel there. The Sage [Buddha] dwells there with his assembly."

When explaining the fourth refutation: Most of it appears in the main texts. The easy-to-understand answer is: The description of Vulture Peak Mountain taught in the Ratnakūṭa refers to when the Buddha blessed it while teaching the Dharma, while the other refers to explaining conventional reality in the Abhidharma.

Regarding the fifth refutation: According to your view, are both explaining the nature of reality, or are both from the perspective of poets? If the first:

The Abhidharma's explanation of Lake Anavatapta and the four great rivers would contradict reality, as it doesn't match even slightly with what is proven by valid cognition today. For example, the Abhidharma explains that Lake Manasarovar is in the north, but today it appears in the south. It explains that Mount Gandhamādana is north of the ocean, but it appears in the south. It explains that the Ganges flows east from an elephant's mouth, but today it is clearly observed flowing west through the middle of the ocean, having originated from something other than a lake. You accept these descriptions as definitive.

If the second: When the Abhidharma explains the measurements of the world systems as merely conventional truth without actual existence, what is wrong with saying poets embellished it?

Whether you accept that Vulture Peak Mountain's description as high, round, filled with flowers, various wild animals, and many ponds and pools was blessed at that time, disappeared in the degenerate age, or was poetic license, there is no contradiction. It is like the introduction to the Prajñāpāramitā which describes this Sahā world system becoming like a lotus world system.

Secondly, if one accepts that the Ganges River, which is commonly known to both ordinary people and scholars in India, is the Ganges that flows from Lake Anavatapta, one cannot establish evidence that Lake Manasarovar is not Lake Anavatapta. If one does not accept this, two difficulties arise that contradict both scripture and reasoning.

As stated in the Prajñāpāramitā: "However many rivers flow in this Jambudvīpa, producing flowers, fruits, medicines and forests, they depend on the nāga lord dwelling in Anavatapta. This is the power and glory of that nāga lord." This suggests all great rivers in Jambudvīpa originate from Anavatapta. If so, by tracing the source of these rivers, Lake Anavatapta should be easy to find.

Furthermore, logically, if there were a river flowing south from Lake Anavatapta, it should be apparent to the valid cognition of people in eastern and western India, as there is no southern region of Jambudvīpa not included in its domain.

Having understood the scope of these doubts: There are two [rivers] called Ganges: one commonly known to non-Buddhists and ordinary people, and one uniquely explained in Buddhist teachings. The first originates from Lake Manasarovar, initially flowing west, then reaching western India, turning east, circling north of Vajrāsana (Bodhgaya), and finally flowing into the southern ocean. For this [river], medical treatises and etymology...
The Vinaya and other texts extensively explain about the river Ganga. Among the people of South India it is known as Ganga. The sutras also describe it as being as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges. Similarly, in the land of Sindhu flows the river Sindhu, and in the northern direction is explained to be a river called Shati. However, these are not accepted as flowing from Lake Anavatapta, which according to Abhidharma possesses special qualities. In non-Buddhist texts it is said: "At the mouth of the Ganges, at Kushadvipa, at Bilva, at the Blue Mountain, and at the banks of Kalikami, even bathing cannot lead to rebirth." The detailed explanation of this is that Vishnu, manifesting as a dwarf, killed sixty thousand sons of the Asura king Balavan. They went to hell. Their nephew named Bhagiratha, unable to bear this, supplicated Brahma. The celestial river Ganga, existing in the form of a goddess in the god realm, was transformed into a river. During this process, it became entangled in Maheshvara's dreadlocks for a thousand years. At that time, when supplicating him, a drop from squeezing his dreadlocks flowed to the banks of Mount Kailash. When it flowed to the ocean and went underground, it washed the bones of the sixty thousand Asura sons, and they were reborn in the higher realms after passing from hell. Thus, this river is called Ganga, and because it flows through the celestial realm, earth, and underground, it is known as "three-streamed," "having three paths," and "chariot of the fortunate."

This relies on what was taught, yet this is composed in the manner of poetry, just as the high red cliff is not actually Mount Vindhya. The thirty-ninth question asks: "The Gandhamadana mentioned in Abhidharma - did the earlier position accept it as Mount Kailash? Since Shambhala's snow mountain was not said to be Kailash, examine what is the connection in the debate response. In our own system, is the Gandhamadana explained in Abhidharma accepted as the snow mountain explained in the tantras? Moreover, can it definitely be accepted that the snow mountain arising from Chakrasamvara and Hevajra is Shambhala's snow mountain?"

Regarding this, there are two parts. First, the reason for asking is that when explaining the meaning of "Thus are the reasons, from glorious Kālachakra..." in this text, most commentators seem to establish as evidence that Mount Kailash is not the snow mountain that is part of the great country, citing inconsistencies with Kālachakra, contradictions with Abhidharma, and disagreement with the Avatamsaka Sutra. Second, the fault of not asking: Looking at the literal meaning of the phrases in the text "In glorious Kālachakra and in Abhidharma texts...", although it appears that both sources extensively explain the characteristics of the same snow mountain in agreement, this cannot be accepted as such. If one can accept that it is not the snow mountain that is part of the thirty-seven countries merely because it disagrees with the explanation of the snow mountain in Kālachakra, then this creates uncertainty about the Himalayas which both mention as a great country. Furthermore, should one accept or not accept that the snow mountain connected with Lake Anavatapta is the snow mountain that is part of the thirty-seven countries? If the former, it contradicts the explanation in Jetsun's pure commentary that the snow mountain which is part of the thirty-seven countries is located at the border of Nepal and Tibet. If the latter, it seems inconsistent with the context of this text above and below.

Master Rali, regarding this treatise's composition, [concerning] the snow mountains of both Abhidharma and Kālachakra...
Here's the translation of the Tibetan text:

They appear to say "the differences were not distinguished." This has the same meaning as the previous doubt. Second, regarding the actual response: While the earlier position accepted Mount Kailash as a great place that enhanced the realization of vidyādharas, to prove this is not the case: it is neither the Snow Mountain spoken of in the Abhidharma, nor the Snow Mountain mentioned in the Kālacakra, nor the Snow Mountain described in the Great Peacock Sūtra and other texts.

According to this treatise's author, the Snow Mountain that is included among the thirty-seven sacred places must be explained as either the one described in the Abhidharma or the Kālacakra. Otherwise, one would not know how to arrange the textual sequences, and if one accepts a Snow Mountain other than these, to prove it is not that: just as the reasoning and scripture that prove Kailash is not the Snow Mountain state: "As spoken in the glorious Kālacakra and Abhidharma texts..."

Furthermore, the Gateway for Scholars states: "Himālaya refers to the abode of Maheshvara, Umā's father, near Lake Manasarovar, called the Snow Mountain. Some ignorant translators are seen to have translated it as Kailash." Also, the Venerable one states in the Tree: "Himālaya belongs to Nepal, which is Tibet's upper region." We should examine whether this intention accords with this.

The Snow Mountain appearing in the Cakrasaṃvara cannot be explained as identical to the Snow Mountain of Shambhala. Since even finding scriptural sources for just the land of Shambhala in other tantras is extremely difficult, how much more so would it be to establish an apparent agreement between the Snow Mountains explained in these two systems?

The fortieth question asks: "Where is there a clear explanation of the armies being led to Shambhala through the magical powers of the mlecchas?" Regarding this, there are two parts. First, the reason for the question is based on the literal reading of the text: "In the degenerate age, the Noble Land will be filled with mleccha dharma. Then, through the magical powers of the mlecchas..." and because all commentators have explained about armies being led to Shambhala through mleccha magic.

Second, the fault of not asking: In the Kālacakra Tantra and its commentaries, it is explained that Kalkin Rudracakrin leads armies from Shambhala to wherever the mlecchas are situated, but there does not appear any clear explanation of mleccha kings leading armies to Shambhala. The proof for this is found in the glorious Tantra: "To destroy the mlecchas, the lord of humans endowed with twelve powers goes forth. Having destroyed the mleccha dharma piece by piece, Cakrin goes to the place of bliss."

"When the sons and grandsons of the Kalkin who transform with their hands have passed away in that lineage, at that time the mleccha dharma will definitely enter the land of Mecca. However many evil mleccha lords there are, and however many supreme deities bow to fierce Kalkin, at that time both will engage in fierce conflict in the realm of earth. In battle, the wheel-turning king's own army, complete with four divisions, will emerge at the end of time from the divine city arranged on Mount Kailash to strike all the mlecchas throughout the earth. The fierce lords of the six-faced hosts who steal power will also give assistance to the Kalkin. The lords of men, horses, and elephants, with golden chariots, heroic weapon-bearing kings will also..."

[The text continues about armies moving south of the Sita River]
Having arrived, after fighting with the hordes of barbarians on the earth's surface and defeating the barbarians in battle, when Rigden Dragpo successively travels through the four continents, beginning the last of the four times, doubts may arise.

Second, giving the actual response: When it says the barbarians will lead armies to Shambhala through magical powers, this is taking the analysis to its extreme - it's not that they will actually be able to lead armies there. How so? As taught in the Vinaya and Abhidharma collections, [barbarians] are not suitable vessels for the expansive teachings during the time when Rigden Dragpa teaches the Dharma.

How are these contradictions resolved? These refutations are also well established as resolved.

The forty-first question is: Where is it explained that Rigden Dragpo is actually an emanation of Vajrapani?

In the text it states: "Then an emanation of Vajrapani called Dragpo, the king, having defeated all the barbarians..." Most commentators do not analyze this at all. Pökhangpa explains it as "Then an emanation of Manjushri Kirti..." and this is also written in Kumara's commentary.

Second, the fault of not asking: While in definitive meaning all Buddhas are one dharmakaya and therefore an emanation of one can be an emanation of another, in interpretive meaning, based on individual tantras, Buddha form bodies are established separately. When aspirational prayers determine separate enlightened activities, one must explain without mixing up which emanation belongs to whom. This is because in the Kalachakra, the emanations of the thirteen bodhisattvas and ten wrathful ones are explained as unmixed.

As stated in the root tantra quoted in the Great Commentary: "The past king Suryaprabha was an emanation of Vighantaka. Vajrapani, Noble Moon, you are Ksitigarbha, Yama-antaka, Sarvanivarana-vishkambhi, and in sequence Stambhana and Akasha-garbha. Manjushri and Lokeshvara in order, the ten wrathful ones like Yamantaka, and the other thirteen bodhisattvas - these will appear in sequence in the Kalki lineage. The Kalki Kirti lineage, then Kalki Pundarika, third is Kalki Bhadra, likewise fourth is Vijaya. Kalyanamitra, Ratnapani, seventh is Vishnu-gupta. Suryakirti and Subhadra, Samudravijaya and Durjaya, twelfth Kalki Surya, Vishvarupa and Chandraprabha, Ananta and Mahipala, Shripala and Simhanatha, Mahabala and Aniruddha, Narasimha and Maheshvara, Kalki Anantavijaya, and Kalki Kirti again. Then his son Chakravartin, Kalki Rudra will appear, who through the samadhi of the supreme steed of eloquence, will end the barbarians' dharma. Whatever eloquent teachers like Suryaratha appear, you Noble Moon are the compiler of the root tantra and also the composer of the extensive commentary. Here you fully ripen beings. Manjushri Vajra's condensed tantra has Padmapani himself as its extensive commentator."

This explains that Rigden Dragpo Chakravartin was born as the son of the twenty-fourth Kalki, Anantavijaya. Just because there is no contradiction between the situations of Manjushri and Vajrapani, if one can explain Rigden Dragpo as Vajrapani's emanation, one could also explain King Chandrabhadra as Manjushri's emanation, which would make all the presentations of that time confused. Furthermore, explaining Dragpo as Manjushri Kirti's emanation...
Due to ignorance of the distinction between emanation and rebirth, this is a mistake. For in the Tantra Commentary it is explained that he was reborn as that one, while for an emanation, it is definite that the emanator must not have demonstrated the aspect of passing into nirvana. When these objections arise, there are two responses: according to the provisional meaning and according to the definitive meaning.

First, regarding the provisional meaning: When explaining how both Vajrapāṇi, the Lord of Secrets, and Mañjuśrī, in both their saṃsāric state and their bodhisattva state, had different substantial continuums and lineages, at that time Rudra must be explained as an emanation of Mañjuśrī. This is because there is no dispute that King Mañjuśrīkīrti was his emanation, and scripture establishes without dispute that Rudra was his rebirth.

Therefore, according to this text: "At that time, a king called Rudra, an emanation of Mañjuśrī Vajra, conquered all the barbarians..."

One should not think that changing the words of the text through one's own conceptual fabrications becomes a fault of distorting the Dharma. Due to the power of time, there appear to be many corrupt texts, such as: "From the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras and treatises, the dharmadhātu in the three times..." and what should have been stated in the Āryaratnakaraṇḍa as "Though the lion fears nothing..." and what should have appeared in the Mahāyānottaratantra as "Even to the blind tīrthikas of ignorance..." appear differently.

The evidence for this is that while the Mother Sūtras explain the dharmadhātu as being free from the three times and three realms, they do not explain it as being free from virtue and non-virtue. In the Ratnakūṭa, the example of the lion fearing fire does not appear. And if such a passage about "blind tīrthikas of ignorance" existed in Maitreya's Uttaratantra, it would contradict the venerable one's own text that states "For what reason and purpose..."

Second, regarding the definitive meaning: When applied to the inner body, it is acceptable to posit Rudra as an emanation of Vajrapāṇi. As stated in the Glorious Tantra: "In one's own body, the Wheel-Bearer is Vajradhara, the supreme deity who blocks the twelve limbs. The Dignitaries are perfect wisdom, elephants, horses, chariots, servants, the Noble Immeasurables. Rudra, named Self-Conqueror, Hanuman represents the śrāvakas, the fierce barbarian lords. The sins of living beings are whatever actions of harmful intellect create clouds of suffering, the paths of non-virtue. Dwelling on horses is ignorance, all the asura forces are the four kinds of māras. Conquering in that battle overcomes the fears of existence - the glorious victor's path to liberation."

And further: "Thus there will be conflict with the barbarian lords, certainly in the center of embodied beings' bodies. The illusory forms externally will certainly have conflict with barbarians in the land of Mecca, yet it is not conflict."

In its great commentary: "The Wheel-Bearer mentioned in the first chapter externally is, in the body, the Vajra-Bearer, meaning Thugs Vajra (Mind Vajra). The twelve supreme deities and lords including Īśvara are the blockers of the twelve limbs," and so forth is extensively explained.

Here, "Thugs Vajra" must be explained as the definitive Vajrapāṇi, as stated in the Śrīparamādya: "The beginningless and endless great being..." up to "The lord of vajra pride, the supreme primordial being."

The forty-second question is: "How through the particulars of knots..." and so forth about arhats and pratyekabuddhas...
When cited as proof of self-realization, how can the quotation from the Ornament of Mahāyāna Sūtras be reconciled with Cittamātra texts? Regarding this, there are two points. The first reason for asking is: When refuting the concept of "single white remedy" and conventional designations, it is explained that all three vehicles realize emptiness, as stated: "Through the view of emptiness one transcends suffering; through skillful means one attains complete enlightenment" and "By meditating on emptiness alone, one cannot realize emptiness itself. Even if emptiness is realized, one falls into the cessation of śrāvakas." This is clearly shown by citing that passage from the Ornament of Mahāyāna Sūtras as evidence.

Second, the fault of not asking would be: According to the Ornament of Mahāyāna Sūtras' own system, śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas would realize the selflessness of phenomena, since all three vehicles directly realize emptiness. If accepted, this would align with the Niḥsvabhāvavāda texts, since the meaning of the selflessness of phenomena must be explained as all phenomena being empty of inherent nature.

The actual response has two parts: the direct answer and an ancillary explanation of the refutation of the "single white remedy." Regarding the first: Later Tibetan scholars universally assert that when one realizes emptiness and dharmadhātu, one must realize the selflessness of phenomena as grasped objects. Although this view, based ultimately on Candrakīrti's system, is widely accepted like the wind, it is not the system of the Maitreya texts and Svātantrika Madhyamaka.

For in the Madhyāntavibhāga, the bases of division - suchness, absolute truth, emptiness, and dharmadhātu - are divided into two types of emptiness: emptiness that is empty of subject-object duality in terms of persons, and emptiness that is empty of subject-object duality in terms of phenomena. The first is realized even by noble śrāvakas. The second is further divided into partial and pervasive emptiness. The first is realized even by pratyekabuddhas, while the second is termed "supreme suchness" and its direct realization is exclusively a distinguishing feature of Mahāyāna nobles. This is undoubtedly the system of the middle three Maitreya texts and their followers.

Moreover, both Āryavimuktisena and Haribhadra explain how dharmadhātu establishes the lineages causally, in accordance with the Madhyāntavibhāga and Abhidharmasamuccaya. Nevertheless, it seems somewhat difficult to explain how this text states that there is no difference in the realization of emptiness by the three types of spiritual trainees, and that the difference in superior and inferior results is due to methods. This is because the accomplishment of awakening by the three types must definitely be established not only through different methods but also through different ways of eliminating obscurations through wisdom.

Although this is so, what follows from this? One might wonder: Doesn't this contradict the text's statement that "Just as threads mostly similar in quality yield better or worse cloth depending on the weaving, similarly emptiness is mostly similar but better or worse results come from methods"? This fault is not damaging because the "single white remedy" refers to the view of emptiness divorced from method. When divorced from method, there is no distinction between greater and lesser vehicles. Without this distinction, meditating on emptiness alone leads only to the nirvāṇa of extinction. This must be explained as the meaning. Without generating the supreme aspiration for enlightenment, even though one meditates on emptiness, supreme emptiness meditation does not occur because one does not aspire to its result.

Second, regarding the earlier position in this context: The experience of suchness free from all conceptual elaborations, known as Mahāmudrā, with clear awareness...
If one realizes the nature of the arising [of phenomena] as it is, by merely meditating on that alone, one can actualize the result of the three kāyas [some say]. This is incorrect because without performing the three [practices of] ripening, purification and training, even if one becomes familiar with suchness that negates all elaborations, while one might be able to actualize the dharmakāya that exhausts all cognitive obscurations, one cannot actualize the complete three kāyas of buddhahood, as stated in the Mahāyāna scriptures.

The thirty-third question asks: "If the foundation to be purified and the means of purification do not match when meditating on the yidam through instantaneous generation, what then is this profound and uncontrived generation stage?"

This has two parts. First, the reason for the question: In the text it states, "Even if one meditates on the generation stage a hundred times, having abandoned all the branches of the ritual that properly connect the foundation to be purified with the means of purification, it is merely meditation on artificial instantaneous generation." Taking these words literally, all commentators explain that without the sequence of the three samādhis, the four branches of approach and accomplishment, the five manifest enlightenments and so forth, one cannot purify the foundation through mere instantaneous self-generation as a deity.

If this were so, then generation stage meditation in terms of spontaneous birth would be impossible, and there would be no need to gradually generate the mandala complete with support and supported that is naturally established. The authentic generation stage of instantaneously visualizing and becoming familiar with it would either be impossible or, even if possible, would be unable to purify the impurities of birth, death and the bardo on the foundation. If this were accepted, it would contradict Vajraghaṇṭapāda's statements: "Like beings born spontaneously, meditate without seed," and "The nature of the two artifices is accepted in terms of disciples to be tamed. This is not what is to be accomplished by the wise, for they see the authentic meaning and are liberated," and "These beings are by nature the non-dual mandala that is naturally established."

The actual response explains that this is not showing that if something is an authentic generation stage it must not be instantaneous generation. Rather, it is refuting the assertion that meditation on a mere crude deity figure without even generating from a seed syllable—let alone the five manifest enlightenments—is the generation stage, because it cannot connect with any of the four types of birth.

As stated in the text: "having abandoned all the branches of the ritual that properly connect [the foundation to be purified with the means of purification]" and "artificial instantaneous generation" - these words must be understood in terms of their capacity. In general, as the previous masters taught: The ritual of the five manifest enlightenments purifies birth from warmth and moisture, the two types with and without melodic invocation purify womb birth and egg birth, and instantaneous generation purifies spontaneous birth.

According to Vajraghaṇṭapāda's system, the generation stage that meditates on the mandala complete with support and supported is not only for purifying spontaneous birth. For sharp-faculty individuals, it is taught as a path for purifying all four types of birth. For those of dull and medium faculties, after contemplating the meaning of mantras like SVABHĀVA and purifying the impure aggregates, elements and sense bases, one meditates on the generation stage established by wisdom. Or without such purification, when meditating by visualizing the impure body itself as the celestial palace and the channels and elements as heroes and yoginīs, there is no distinction of pure and impure between the deities and mandala as means of purification, as both must be accepted as being of the nature of wisdom. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the impure body to purify itself.
Ashes, heroes, and yoginis do not transcend the nature of subtle particles. For example, when explaining "the crown of various vajras," the ordinary body's crown has three aspects: the imagined, the conceptual, and the ultimate nature. Of these, the first two are not suitable as the various vajras because they are not primordially established, are comprised of subject and object duality, must be abandoned when transformation is complete, and do not appear in buddha wisdom, so they do not exist.

Therefore, "crown of ultimate nature" refers to the wisdom free from subject-object duality in relation to the impure body's crown. Similarly applying this understanding to other parts, when perfecting the practice of the body mandala, the Chakrasamvara mandala with its support and supported, which is primordially established as the nature of wisdom, becomes manifest.

Therefore, while one may understand the basis to be purified and the purifying agent in this context, there is no need to identify them separately in the direct teaching. From the Buddha's messages of the ten directions: "Most who meditate on the generation stage, without understanding the system of ritual that properly connects the basis to be purified with the purifying agent, are seen to meditate with fabricated instantaneous generation. When supreme practitioners who have reached the heights of clear generation stage primarily practice completion stage, instantaneous generation is taught, but not now. Just as with instantaneous generation of food - don't you need cooking ingredients first? Deity meditation through instantaneous generation without training in the generation stage is similar to this."

The forty-fourth question asks: "In the Fifth Stage, clear light and union are explained as dharmakaya and illusory body, so what contradiction is there in accepting clear light as the ultimate result?"

This has two parts. First, the reason for asking: In the text it states "Some say the ultimate result is clear light. This is not the noble ones' intention." The literal meaning of these words and commentators' explanations do not appear to clarify this point.

Second, the fault of not asking has two aspects - scripture and reasoning. First, scripture: The Charya Samgraha explains clear light's synonyms as dharmakaya, ultimate reality, dharmadhatu, perfection of wisdom, mother of all buddhas, omniscience, knowledge of path aspects, knowledge of all aspects, etc. Chandrakirti's Pradipodyotana states: "Clear light shows supreme reality, realizes supreme union. The ultimate is explained as two aspects. 'Ultimate' means final limit."

The Fifth Stage states: "Rising from ultimate reality, one attains non-dual wisdom. Dwelling in union samadhi, one trains in nothing further. This perfected yogi becomes the great vajra holder with all supreme aspects and becomes omniscient." This explains that after realizing ultimate reality, one arises as the sambhogakaya of union. Since realization of ultimate reality occurs only with realization of the ultimate dharmakaya, and since even in the Paramitayana it is explained that while the ultimate dharmakaya, like a wish-fulfilling jewel, dwells impartially for all beings, the appearance of the two form kayas depends on whether disciples have obtained the mirror of wisdom or not.

The reasoning is: The union explained here as ultimate also has two types - learning and no-learning - as the Fifth Stage states: "The yogis who are still learning..."
It is mentioned "cultivating the union" and "having dwelt in the samadhi of union, one no longer needs to train." At that time, since the trainee's union is not suitable as ultimate, only the union beyond training should be explained as ultimate. Of the two unions, their direct causes of clear light must also be divided into two: with training and beyond training. Without manifesting the dharmakaya of clear light beyond training, one cannot arise as the sambhogakaya of union beyond training. As explained in the Charya Tantra, when Lord Shakyamuni sat under the bodhi tree and manifested clear light at midnight, this establishes that clear light refers to buddha wisdom. One might doubt this.

The ultimate fruit to be attained in the Secret Mantra Vajrayana and the ultimate object of meditation when cultivating the two stages must be explained as the Great Vajradhara of union. As stated in the Samputa Tantra: "The basis to be indicated is the authentic Vajrasattva." The distinction between Secret Mantra and Paramita bodhicitta must be differentiated based on meditating on the body of union versus meditating on dharmakaya alone.

Regarding such union, there are two types: the conforming union with training and the definitive union beyond training. Their respective levels are: the first is attained through post-meditation after the first ground by the power of cultivating the completion stage of Guhyasamaja; the second is the thirteenth ground of the vajra holder. The substantial cause of both unions is the illusory body, which has the name of conventional truth. The cooperative condition is clear light, which has the name of ultimate truth.

The illusory body should not be understood merely as a body that appears but lacks inherent nature like an illusion. Rather, as explained in the Charya Tantra and others, it must be explained as a rainbow-like body formed from the mere co-existence of non-dual wisdom and the five-colored wind-lights, which comes from the ultimate power of familiarizing with the stages of self-blessing after the secret empowerment.

Although clear light must generally be explained as wisdom of emptiness, it is not identical with what appears in the Paramitayana. As made evident in both the Five Stages and Charya Tantra, it must be explained as the wisdom of great bliss obtained from the third empowerment.

Regarding how these two causal truths manifest the resultant body of union, the great translator Gö made three divisions: those with diligence who attain enlightenment in this life; those who are lazy and attain enlightenment in the bardo; and those with obstacles who attain enlightenment over successive lives.

For the first: During the stage of familiarizing with the illusory body, having already familiarized with any of the three conducts, by the power of remaining in equipoise in clear light for years, months and so forth, one can manifest as the body of Vajradhara through making the aspiration to manifest the body of union. This ability comes from having previously engaged in conduct and the power of long familiarization with ultimate truth.

For the second: A yogi who, due to incomplete yoga, has not engaged in conduct and though seeing truth, due to attachment to the extremes of karma, cannot manifest the body of union in this life makes this aspiration: When the clear light of death manifests, having manifested the clear light of the path, one manifests as the sambhogakaya that which would otherwise arise as bardo existence.
As for the first, it is like King Indrabhūti; the second is like Ācārya Nāgārjuna. As for the third, if one has not reached the completion of clear light at the time of death, one achieves the unified kāya through taking birth in places such as those of vidyādharas and sky-goers.

The established meaning of this explanation is that when, through the clear light wisdom based on the illusory body as the proximate cause of unification, all obscuring habitual tendencies are eliminated, at that moment the first instant of that elimination, the first moment of omniscience, and the manifestation of the unified Vajradhara kāya occur simultaneously. At that time, when the clear light and illusory body are not separate but mix inseparably as one, this is called unification. This is the non-learning unification, the thirteenth vajra-holder level.

Thus, what is designated as the unified kāya is the inseparable dharmakāya of the three kāyas. This does not explain the display of form kāyas appearing from the ultimate dharmakāya as arising from clear light into a unified kāya.

Furthermore, even if one eliminates mere obscurations to be abandoned through seeing with clear light based on that illusory body support, but does not maintain equipoise for long, although remaining obscurations persist, emerging from that equipoise, the clear light wisdom in the post-meditation and the deity's form established from mere wind-mind like a rainbow mixing inseparably is called the learning unification.

Since this is learning, although not the ultimate result, it is explained as ultimate in consideration of being the culmination of the fifth stage, as there is no need to seek another sixth stage not found beyond that. If asked how one eliminates the remaining obscurations with this, one eliminates them by again entering the clear light stage, corresponding to the term "entering clear light through special aspiration."

Thus, when clear light is explained as a synonym for dharmakāya, of the two aspects of clear light - the object emptiness and the subject wisdom - the first is the natural dharmakāya and the second is the adventitiously pure dharmakāya. This should be similarly applied to prajñāpāramitā and the three knowledges.

Otherwise, if merely explaining it as dharmakāya makes it ultimate, then the illusory body, which is a conventional truth term, would also be ultimate. As stated in the Māyākrama: "Conventional truth itself is illusion, the sambhogakāya is also that, that itself becomes a gandharva being, and that itself is the vajra kāya. The stable Vajrasattva is taught to be conventional truth." And from the words of Goes Lotsāwa: "The synonyms for 'like illusion' are: Vajrasattva, conventional truth, sambhogakāya, and illusion."

Furthermore, the explanation that Śākyamuni manifested clear light under the bodhi tree is not explained in terms of having already become enlightened at that time. Rather, as explained in the Fifth Stage citing the Lalitavistara scripture, it teaches the way of training in the path for followers by explaining the previous life story in accordance with the Śrāvaka schools.

The synonyms for this unified kāya are explained as: the form of a great awareness being, abiding in the way of the two truths, the heroic progress samādhi, the vajra-like samādhi, the unobstructed path, unification, and so forth. Some explain its level as the tenth bhūmi, but the refutation of that should be seen elsewhere.
During this time, discussing this Dharma, to restrain and renounce, I have arranged one hundred relevant explanations. Through this, many realizations will greatly increase while some discussions will be cut short. For those few who feed on unhappiness, though jealousy burns the firewood of their own minds a hundred times, may the cooling waters of these well-spoken words refresh them. This concludes the third section of the treatise called "The Golden Scalpel of Elegant Sayings," concerning the knowledge holders' vows from the treatise "Distinguishing the Three Vows."

Question Forty-Five: Regarding the statement "If the Pratimoksha vows taken until enlightenment are destroyed, what about the training in ethics until the essence of enlightenment?" This has two parts. First, the reason for asking: Later commentators on this treatise, taking the Pratimoksha vows - which are the main subject matter of the three vows explained here - identify them as the Bodhisattva Pratimoksha mentioned in the Bodhisattva Pitaka, and appear to accept that the three vows exist simultaneously in the continuums of those who possess all three vows in ascending order.

The fault of not asking would be: Then it would be incorrect to take the Bodhisattva's vow of restraining from misconduct until enlightenment, because if one takes the Pratimoksha vows until then, it would alter the essential points of the Pratimoksha, and the Pratimoksha that is one of the three appears to be explained as the Bodhisattva's Pratimoksha.

Second, the actual answer: This fault does not apply because the Pratimoksha vows explained here as one of the three refer to the Pratimoksha vows that come from the common vehicle's Vinaya. This is clear from statements such as: "If the Pratimoksha vows are taken until enlightenment..." and "Therefore, for the person who says the Pratimoksha vows exist even after death, there is no distinction of the pitakas," and "After generating bodhicitta in mind, perform the ritual according to the Śrāvaka tradition."

Otherwise, the three sections beginning with "The Pratimoksha vows..." and "The supreme training of the Bodhisattvas..." and "The empowerment of Secret Mantra..." would not serve to prevent confusion about the essential points of the three vows that are the main subject matter of this treatise.

Question Forty-Six: What is the clear reason for Marpa not having Vajrayogini's blessing? I have heard it said that Marpa definitely performed Vajrayogini's blessing first in the complete five stages. This has two parts. First, the reason for asking: Some commentators on this text explain literally that Marpa did not have her blessing, while most explanations, like that of the Samye tradition, explain that this was not his system of opening the dharma gates.

The fault of not asking would be: According to the first tradition, while authoritative sources include Marpa the Translator in the lineage of Vajrayogini, saying he didn't have her blessing would be extremely presumptuous and would also disparage other blessing lineages. According to the second tradition, Marpa the Translator, before giving instruction on the complete five stages, erected Vajrayogini's Sindhura mandala and bestowed the three higher empowerments, and even before that, bestowed the vase empowerment in Guhyasamaja's powder mandala, as is well-known in those lineages. And from the lord lama's words also, the supreme being Marpa from Naro...
From the genuine disciple of the Noble One, the great siddha Matingpa, received the empowerment transmission that was passed down to Guru Tilopa, the instructions of the single tantra, and the guidance teachings of the five stages of completion. For each of the three higher empowerments, there was a sindura mandala, beneath which was a skull cup filled with chang, and beneath that was a triangular dharmodaya made of colored powder. Even in the third higher empowerment, there was the descent of wisdom, the throwing of flowers in the mandala, and so forth.

Marpa Lotsawa said that without Vajrayogini's blessing and that blessing opening certain doors of completion stage dharma, this is not the system. This is not the intended meaning of this text. Rather, regarding the dharma door of Phagmo Drupa, in the entry of Vajrayogini's blessing, the meaning is indicated through four symbols including the pig's head. Making the unripened students ripened through empowerment, applying the convention of "opening the dharma door," and after completing the meaning of ripening empowerment to that extent, the meditation on profound instructions such as the Six Dharmas of Naropa is not the system of Marpa Lhodrakpa, as appropriate appearances were not observed in that system, as clearly stated: "While holding Marpa's lineage, opening the dharma door through Vajrayogini..."

The forty-seventh question asks whether the Six Dharmas existed or not from Lord Milarepa onwards, inquiring about the text's intended meaning. If they existed, how could this contradict following Naropa's lineage? If they did not exist, how were the three systems of the Six Dharmas heard? The learned ones consider the so-called "Chakrasamvara Oral Transmission" to be false teachings.

[The translation continues to cover the remaining discussion about the Six Dharmas' transmission through Milarepa and his disciples, particularly addressing various interpretations and potential contradictions in the lineage accounts.]
Furthermore, since the essence is not visible, regarding the Six Dharmas of Naropa, there are two categories: those connected with tantra and those connected with blessing. It is explained that both of these exist in those after Milarepa, but not in those before him, as this is how the emphasis was placed. It is explained that Rechungpa possessed the Six Dharmas connected with empowerment and blessing. However, this seems contradictory to the statement that "Marpa Lhodrapa did not have the blessing of Vajrayogini," which explains that this tradition did not have the opening of dharma doors through blessing.

Some say that the Six Dharmas of Naropa that Milarepa gave to Rechungpa are those contained in the well-known Chakrasamvara Oral Lineage, and that other Six Dharmas did not exist in those after Milarepa. This is incorrect because the Chakrasamvara Oral Lineage was composed by Marpa Dopa, who compiled one hundred and eight Indian dharma teachings, including many dharmas connected with Chakrasamvara empowerment and blessing, and some instructions from the Six Dharmas of Naropa, composing them independently. These are not teachings passed down from Marpa and Milarepa.

As explained by many scholars like Chakra Lotsawa who authenticated the pure dharma of the past, this needs to be examined. Regarding the three traditions of the Six Dharmas of Naropa that this treatise's author heard, one wonders whether he heard them in the tradition of the Chakrasamvara Oral Lineage or as the three traditions of the Six Dharmas with broken lineage.

The second point, giving the actual answer: The meaning of "none existed before Milarepa" does not mean there were no Six Dharmas before Milarepa. Rather, it means that before Milarepa, Naropa's lineage holders did not practice anything other than the Six Dharmas of Naropa, such as Lamdre or Mahamudra's "white single cure." Lord Gampopa abandoned exclusively practicing the Six Dharmas and meditated on the "white single cure" named Mahamudra. Phagmo Drupa achieved realization through practicing Lamdre. While meditating on instructions other than Naropa's view, these other lineages were kept secret, and claiming to be only Naropa's lineage holder contradicts both one's own and others' traditions. Therefore, this treatise states there is no contradiction in not claiming to be Naropa's lineage holder when, despite having heard the Six Dharmas, one does not practice them intensively.

The forty-eighth question asks: "What contradiction is there in pursuing Naropa's lineage while practicing Mahamudra?" The reason for this question relates to the literal meaning of the text saying "Mahamudra and so forth," and the commentaries by Phukhangpa mentioning "Maitri's Mahamudra" and Gadongpa referring to "Five-fold Mahamudra." The fault of not asking would be that there is no contradiction in pursuing Naropa's lineage while practicing Mahamudra, as those known as Mahamudra practitioners claim to practice Mahamudra transmitted from both Naropa and Maitripa, accepting separate lineages from each, but not claiming transmission from Maitripa alone.

Regarding the actual answer to the second point: It is a mistake to explain the terms "conqueror" and "endowed" separately as "conquering the four maras" and "possessing the six qualities." Rather, the single Sanskrit term "bhaga" applies to both "conqueror" and "fortune," while "wan" means "endowed." Thus, "Bhagawan" means one who is endowed with both conquest and fortune, and therefore applies only to the perfect Buddha. Even so, the great translators of the past...
Intending to apply to either of these two, although the word "'das" does not exist [in Sanskrit], it appears to have been added.

The fiftieth question asks: Regarding the etymology of Mahāmudrā, if one is confused about the meaning of the word 'hand' (phyag), why in the Hevajra Tantra are mudrā and its response explained as seals? What is the intended meaning of this teaching? And in the Vajrabhairava Tantra, why are the different hand gestures of the deities explained as Mahāmudrā?

There are two parts to this. First, the reason for the question: According to the literal meaning of the text, where the term for 'hand seal' is explained, it appears to be missing an explanation of the term mudrā which serves as the basis for application.

The fault of not asking would be: If this is so, then in the Hevajra Tantra it states: "By mudrā and the response to mudrā, the samaya is distinguished." And when explaining mudrā itself: "When showing one finger, it is well-accomplished with two. When the left thumb is held, it is known as the needle mudrā. When the ring finger is given, the little finger is given in return. When showing the ring finger, one should show their neck. When showing clothing, one should show the three points. When showing the breast, one should show the junction point."

The explanation of hand gestures as mudrās would be inappropriate because the meaning of 'hand' is already explained there. Furthermore, in the Tantra Samuccaya and Vajrabhairava treatises, Mahāmudrā, which is distinguished from the four mudrās that serve as the means of application, is explained only as the different hand positions of individual deities. If the meaning of 'hand' is explained, it would be unsuitable as the meaning of Mahāmudrā, and would contradict statements such as "Our Mahāmudrā is the wisdom born from empowerment." Such doubts would arise.

Second, the actual response: Here the meaning of the text is that the literal Sanskrit term Mahāmudrā means "great seal." Although the word 'phyag' (hand) is not in the Sanskrit, the translators added it to avoid confusion with other terms, as is commonly known. This is the actual response.

However, this doubt arises: Is the word 'phyag' added by the translators referring to 'hand' or not? If not, what else could it be? If it refers to hand, then when explaining the etymology of the term Mahāmudrā for whatever object it directly names, the meaning of 'hand' would need to be explained, since the translators applied the term thinking of 'phyag' as hand.

If one responds that there are no etymological explanations in Tibetan, then if all etymological explanations must be drawn from Sanskrit, it would be too extreme, because even translators who knew Sanskrit added terms not found in Sanskrit like "divine flower" and "winged bird" which have etymological explanations, and even old scholars who didn't know Sanskrit gave many names based on etymological reasoning.

The response to the second doubt: Although it would be most appropriate to say it's the difference between the four mudrās of Yoga Tantra and the four mudrās of Highest Yoga Tantra, even so, one must determine this definitively by finding clear, undisputed sources for the four mudrās of Highest Yoga Tantra.

Thus, since questions eleven and the following two share the same subject matter, they are counted as one, making one hundred questions and answers.

Of the eight supplementary questions, the first asks: If "Tilo" is unsuitable for "Telo," why is the letter "i" explained as "e" in the Kalāpa grammar? Although "Nāro" is a specific brahmin name, isn't "ta" applied as an honorific term?
From the two, first regarding the question's intention:

Just as "tilo" refers to sesame grinding, "tela" also refers to the same. There are two ways to establish this - through scriptural authority and through reasoning. First, from scripture: In Kalapa it states "e e ta u o ta" applies to substances, to Sambudhi, and to "that." Since the plural of the first case, the vocative, and the singular of the fourth case in the latter have "i" changing to "e" and "u" changing to "o," and since the Kunshed states "as it is said, these are the qualities of grammar" explaining that for the agent, "i," "u," and "krit" change to "e," "o," and "kara" respectively, and since the Second Connection states "ya is for what is not similar to the letter i, and is not to be separated," explaining that ya-btags must be read with the sound of a short vowel, and since the Great Commentary Drime Öd clearly explains the name of sesame grinding as "tai tilam" among the eleven actions, and through reasoning: just as "trologa" and "triloka" have the same meaning, and "loke" and "loki" apply to the same meaning, and "gou" and "go" apply to the same meaning, and "uryan" and "odin" apply to the same meaning.

Second, the actual answer: If "tila" is translated, it means "drop" or if left untranslated but modified, it means "sesame." Since "ota" refers to grinding, when combined it becomes "telopa" which is the correct Sanskrit term. But not understanding its general meaning, thinking "ti" would be incorrect, calling it only by the name "te" shows lack of understanding. Even so, "telo" referring to sesame grinding is not incomprehensible, just as with "dibu" and "deva," "vita" and "beta," and "luiba" and "lohiba."

Furthermore, it is proper to explain that in Sanskrit, the term "Naro" refers to a specific Brahmin caste, as "Narota" means "Naropa." Also, the Sanskrit "Indrabhuti," which in Tibetan refers to "hundred powers enlightenment," is explained in the scholars' gateway, as stated by Acharya Rinchen Jungne Zhiwa:

[Continues with explanation of Buddhist terminology and Sanskrit-Tibetan equivalences, maintaining the same detailed technical discussion of linguistic points through to the end of the passage.]
Being nonexistent, accordingly, the tantra called Svara-udaya spoken by the great god Ishvara, medical treatises like the Eight Branches of Medicine explained by Brahma after recalling the Ayurveda, grammatical sutras like Kalapa explained by Karttikeya to Ishvara's armor, the rhetorical treatise called "Mirror" composed by the non-Buddhist scholar Dandrin, and the lexicographical treatise called "Immortal Treasury" compiled based on Vedic narratives - all these would have to be abandoned. In that case, the first four branches of knowledge would not be common to both Buddhist and non-Buddhist systems. If these are not subjects in which Buddhists should be learned, this would contradict statements from the Ornament of Sutras like: "Without becoming learned in the five branches of knowledge, even the supreme noble ones cannot attain omniscience." Such doubts arise.

As for the actual response: The Koshika Sutra, being one of the seventeen mother-son scriptures, is completely pure, so one must identify which other impure one appears. The distinction of non-dual victory is well-known among scholars. As for incorrect explanations like Mahamudra Bindu and others, many appear in works like those of Palace Zhiwa Od and Lhodrak's Refutation of Wrong Mantras. One should examine whether there are pure and impure versions of these as well.

The explanation that non-Buddhist scriptures should be abandoned refers to those teaching definitive meaning and the path to liberation. As this very text states: "Therefore, hold the Buddha's teaching as supreme, as valid for definitive meaning." And from the Uttaratantra: "Whatever is explained by a mind free from distraction based solely on the Victor's teaching, conforming to the path for attaining liberation - that too should be accepted on one's head like the sage's word."

The third question asks: "Where is that Uttaratantra quote starting with 'ignorance' etc.? If it exists between the explanation and 'whoever,' why did the venerable one make a definite count of verses from 'thus confidence' onwards?" This has two parts. The questioner's intention regarding the text states: "Its reasoning in the Uttaratantra, Lord Maitreya said thus: 'Though even the non-Buddhists blinded by ignorance have some truth like insect-writing, nevertheless one should not trust in it.'" This quote does not appear in the Uttaratantra treatise.

Those claiming broad vision say this appears between the verses "Whoever has meaning" and "Whoever based on the Victor's teaching" in the commentaries by the great translator and Master Chapa. As they say: "Even those blinded by ignorance, in non-Buddhist treatises like insect-writing, whatever meaningful and dharmic statements eliminate the afflictions of the three realms, and whatever worldly good advice - if the wise accept these like sages, what need to mention what comes from the mouths of those with uncontaminated wisdom?" The great translator and his disciples also composed commentaries on this. If this is so, it would contradict the venerable one's text. How so? As it states: "For what reason, why, how it was explained, and what accords with the cause are taught in four verses. The nature of two pure methods and the cause of degeneration by one - then two verses teach the result. In brief, the two results - accepting the retinue mandala and describing the qualities of enlightenment - are taught by the final ones." From "Thus from scripture and reasoning trusted..." onwards, the explanation...
Here's the translation:

Regarding the collections of Prajnaparamita texts, one might have doubts about contradictions with the explanation of the definite number of ten verses. As for the actual response: In this text, when taking literally the words "Thus spoke Lord Maitreya," it refers to the "other reversal" in the Uttaratantra. The passages about "the non-Buddhist schools darkened by ignorance" explain the sutra that is the subject matter of that text. The verse beginning with "that which has meaning" exists in prose in the Adhyāśayacodanā Sutra and was merely arranged into verse form.

As stated: "Maitreya, furthermore, know that all eloquence is taught by the Buddha through four causes. What are these four? Eloquence that is meaningful, in accordance with Dharma, that eliminates afflictions, and that shows the qualities of nirvana - not that which is meaningless and so forth. Maitreya, these four have been abandoned by the Buddhas. What are these four? Eloquence that is meaningless, not in accordance with Dharma, that increases afflictions, and that does not show the benefits of nirvana - these four have been abandoned and not permitted by the Buddhas."

And from the Mahaparinirvana Sutra: "The teaching of self by non-Buddhists is like letters carved by worms. Therefore, I teach selflessness to all beings. Selflessness is the word of the Buddha." This is cited as evidence, and thus this passage about ignorance is quoted.

The fourth question asks: "From which text does the term 'three councils' originate?"

The fifth question asks: "Where is it explained that Mahadeva's wrong views were refuted in the third council? And from where does this account of Surya-siddhi come?"

Regarding the first question's intent: While everyone agrees on the terminology of the two councils of the Shravakas as taught in the Minor Texts, although the term "third council" is well-known to all, its scriptural source is difficult to know. Here it asks about the source of the statement "heard that a third council was held."

While most traditions explain the third council as establishing the eighteen schools as Buddha's word, here it asks from what source comes the account of refuting Mahadeva's wrong views in the third council. Also, regarding both the meaning and history of the explanation that through Surya-siddhi one can burn whatever desired with sun rays, as this appears difficult to believe, its source is questioned.

As for the actual response to the first question: While the two councils appear in scripture, the third comes from treatises. The Vinaya Prabhāvati explains that the splitting into eighteen schools occurred after the second council. The Tarkajvala states: "Two hundred years after the Teacher's parinirvana, the Elder Vatsiputra correctly compiled the teachings." This must be explained as the third council, because the second council is explained to have occurred 110 years after the Teacher's parinirvana. Although there are many different identifications of this third council, all earlier commentators agree that its purpose was to harmonize the various Shravaka schools that had split apart.

The actual response to the second question: This treatise's evidence for explaining that Mahadeva's wrong views were refuted in the third council [text appears to be cut off here]
At first there were some corruptions in several sections. When these corruptions were exposed, the eighteen schools were established to be in accordance with the Buddha's word. As it is said: "However, through their practice, it is said there were some corruptions even among the eighteen schools. The crown jewel of scholars, Vasubandhu, understood they were not complete because the foundation of the true compilation had deteriorated."

This explanation refers to that. Regarding those who exposed the corruptions in Mahadeva's doctrine, it would be good to explain that they were mostly those who are described as the conveners of the Third Council. This did not occur during Mahadeva's lifetime or immediately after his death, as it is explained that this monk appeared right after the Second Council.

Thus it is heard: In the city called Mathura, there was a merchant's son named Mahadeva who committed three heinous acts. Feeling remorse, he wondered whether there was an opportunity to confess these sins. A monk told him: "Even one who has committed great sins can be purified through virtuous acts. This illuminates the world like the sun free from clouds." Having heard this, he went forth and became learned in the Three Baskets.

When it was his turn to recite sutras in the midst of many Arhats, at the end of the sutra he recited: "The gods are deceived by ignorance; the path arises from the stream of words; those with doubt are led by others - this is the Buddha's teaching." When the Arhats disputed that this was not the Buddha's word, most of the young monks took his side. Based on this dispute in the Sangha, it led to the eighteen schools. Thus explain the commentators of the scriptures.

Regarding the meaning of "because the foundation of the true compilation had deteriorated," as explained in the Vyākhyāyukti: "The sutras of Bhadanta, Ālokakara, Duḥkhaskandha, Bhūmaka, Udayakara Śūnyatā, Jalamaja, Nāga, Sāgara, Jalataruṇa, Nirvāṇa, Rāṣṭrapāla, Jagaccandra and others - because the foundation of the true compilation had deteriorated, it is understood they are not complete."

The meaning of this is that these texts exist in the context of establishing the Mahayana as Buddha's word. If one says the Mahayana is not Buddha's word because it contains not even a little definitive meaning, then you who say this have not seen even all the Śrāvaka baskets, let alone the Mahayana. The proof of this is that even today the Śrāvaka baskets are not preserved completely because the foundation of the true compilation has deteriorated. For example, while other texts prove that certain words existed in sutras named Bhadanta, Ānanda and so forth mentioned above, these words do not appear in those sutras today.

Although it seems somewhat difficult to take this as proof that Mahadeva's doctrine corrupted the eighteen schools, it seems necessary to explain that Mahadeva later inserted some contradictory elements after removing those incomplete scripture passages.

The third point of analysis is difficult to answer. As explained in Lha btsun bsam yas pa's commentary: "This story is merely well-known among Tibetan masters but has not been seen explained in Indian texts. Moreover, it must have occurred before Ārya Nāgārjuna appeared, otherwise many inconsistencies would arise."

The sixth question: Between Dharma's suppression of the teaching and Lord Ye shes 'od, what various false dharmas flourished? In Rinchen Zangpo's treatise, except for merely prohibiting the practices of union and liberation, who refuted all the false dharmas?
In regards to the temple scriptures, which were not visible, and concerning Pho brang Zhi ba 'od and Gos's refutation of wrong mantras, some harm appears to oneself. When Buddhism was well established in these snow mountains, and during the flourishing of the doctrine, King Darma suppressed the teachings. Afterward, many wrong doctrines proliferated. At that time, Master Ye shes 'od appeared.

From the literal reading of these words, it appears as though many wrong doctrines didn't emerge before King Darma. However, other early commentators explained that many false tantras appeared from the time of King Trisong Deutsen until Darma. The text states that "all wrong doctrines were eliminated," yet in the great translator's treatise, regarding the supreme tantras, while refuting the literal interpretation of union and liberation practices, he mainly established the interpretable and definitive meanings. Since this author didn't specifically identify which wrong texts were composed, how were all wrong doctrines eliminated?

In Zhi ba 'od's and Gos's extensive writings, they describe as impure such new tantric teachings as Mahamudra Bindu, Wisdom Bindu, the Three Rains, the Fourth Seal, the Twenty and Thirty Chapters of Mahayana, the Definitive Teaching on Illusion, the Definitive Teaching on Dreams, and others. As evidence of these teachings being impure, Gos's extensive writing cites that when seventy-two Indian panditas were asked, they said these didn't exist in India. Ngog Lho brag pa, who became Gos's lineage holder, asked these same seventy-two contemporary panditas about some of Bla chen 'Brog mi's profound teachings, and they also said these didn't exist in India.

Although Gos was equal to Bla chen and Gayadhara as their student, there appears to be some bias regarding teachings that emerged there but not in his own tradition. Regarding the actual response: The meaning of "wrong doctrines proliferated" after Darma suppressed the teachings doesn't indicate that all impure tantras were composed exactly at that time, as some appeared both before and after. For example, those composed by Master Rma Rinchen Chog and Master Nyan chen Pal yang appeared earlier, while Nub Sangye Yeshe Rinpoche appeared contemporaneously with Lord Pal khor tsan po, thus after Darma.

The statement about wrong doctrines proliferating doesn't refer merely to the new composition and spread of impure tantras at that time. Some works by Rma Rinchen Chog and Dar chen Pal gyi Dragpa, though not actual tantras, are faultless treatises composed in accordance with tantras, like Chomden Ral gri's pure explanation of the Guhyagarbha.

What then? After Darma suppressed the teachings, there was no Vinaya, so people didn't understand the need to establish ethical discipline of individual liberation as the root. Whether pure or impure tantras, taking their explicit teachings literally, they engaged freely in the ten non-virtues while claiming this was Dharma. To refute this, the great translator's treatises never specifically named certain tantras as inauthentic. Taking the explicit teachings of tantras literally and practicing them contradicts the scriptures of the two higher tantra classes, some Mahayana sutras, and their commentaries.
Drawing upon authoritative treatises and citing numerous textual sources, he composed this extraordinary refuting treatise. Regarding the second critical analysis: While it is accepted that Lo Pandit translated scriptures and canonical texts, if these were unknown to the many panditas of India, they would be established as corrupted. However, the profound oral instructions cannot be established as corrupted by such reasoning alone. The Great Translator made these arguments concerning tantras and treatises, not concerning the oral instructions. Examples of what cannot be established include the Six Dharmas of Naropa and Niguma.

Therefore, how could Lo Chen Gos have criticized Drogmi's profound teachings? Ngog made his own independent versions. The various names of corrupted teachings are clearly explained in the letters of Palace Shiwa Ö, the greater and lesser extensive writings of Gos Lotsawa, Tsami Lotsawa's Great Letter, Ngog Lhodragpa's Great Account Explaining the History of Secret Mantra, and Chag Lotsawa's letters. However, not everything explained in these must necessarily be considered false teachings.

Incidentally, in a treatise composed by a discerning one named Paldzin from the northern region of Ü, it appears thus:

One called Maben Rinchen Chog composed the Guhyagarbha Tantra. When the king heard and sought it, it is said he hid for twelve years. Later King Tri Darma destroyed the Buddha's teachings and died, demolishing both royal and religious law. All translators and panditas fled to border regions. Without witnesses and fear, evil Tibetan tantrikas composed only false tantras. Wrong practices of union and liberation spread like fire.

In the time of Lord Palkhor Tsen, Nupchen Sangye Yeshe appeared. He created limitless practice instructions and eight tantras including Yamantaka and others, six supplementary tantras, likewise six king tantras, mixing especially the Hwashang view and instructional garland of views. For the gateway of Dzogchen, he created thirteen including Extraordinary. 

Then Palgi Dragpa made five great mind treatises including the All-Gathering Wisdom Sutra and others. Nyangtö Mawa Senge created eighteen mother and son Mind Class texts including the All-Creating King. Tsetsün Senge Wangchuk created the Vimalamitra Heart Essence and its seventeen great tantras.

King Yudra Nyingpo's personal instructions and view garland were later converted to Dzogchen teachings by his lineage holders and attributed to Kathog. Many false treasure revealers appeared like Lord Nyangben Ralpacan, Guru Chöwang, Chölo, Dharma King Rinchen Lingpa, Nirmanakaya Urgyen Lingpa, Tseten Gyaltsen and others.

Countless false dharma treasures emerged like the Eight Proclamations Assembly of Sugatas, Hayagriva Assembly of Sugatas, and Life Lord Urmo. Pema Ledrel Tsel created the Dakini Heart Essence teachings. Terton Dorje Lingpa created the Vajrasattva Heart Essence.

And among the new secret mantras are: The Great Victorious Non-Dual Guhyasamaja, Vajrabhairava Sam tradition, thirty-two Chakrasamvara Rali, Kalacakra Fox Song and Dance, Hevajra's Four Treasures of Body Speech Mind and Secret, Vajrapani Achala, Vajravarahi Simhamukha, some Mahamudra tantras, and protector and goddess
The hundred and fifty tantras and more are not mere fabricated false tantras. The Vajra Essence Later Commentary and the Omniscient Lhopa composed what is known as Naropa's Great Commentary. When refuting these, your initial title alone reveals errors in translation, showing your true identity. Most errors occur in the mantra sections, with mistakes in both mantras and etymologies. First blowing gives "buddhaya," in the middle spreading gives "dharmaya," at the end purifying gives "sanghaya" - such etymologies are written in the tantras. The six letters ca, cha, ja, zha, za, and 'a are mixed with Sanskrit. Each consonant cluster is adorned with two, three or four vowels. Rbad, rbud, kham shag, ro myags chums, Thötreng Tsal, Drobo Löd, e myags, ya rdubs, mugs shag dun, bai ril dun thibs, trig trig khram, her shog, nir shog, rgyug breng breng, mnal ma mnal te, threatening to kill, Vajra Zhang Zhung and others - these are confused mantras.

Within their minds, deities the size of mustard seeds - such are non-Buddhist religious systems. In the practice of the All-Creating King, the vajra body bindings and all physical postures and gazes are forbidden. They view perfect meditation as faulty. Common behaviors disturb the mind. When all these impure karmic appearances are understood as dharmadhatu itself, since all faults become qualities, as soon as one hears such instructions, one becomes a Buddha! In the practice of the secret cycle of the bardo, "releasing into the ocean of ar" means squinting the eyes to look into darkness and maintaining the altered perceptual experience of the senses. From Vimalamitra's Heart Essence, they claim it supreme to maintain rainbow light by looking at sunlight, moonlight and lamplight through squinting eyelashes. This meditation of sun-gazing is the system of non-Buddhist sun worshippers. When one can move material objects through releasing one's awareness, they say three thousand generations will achieve buddhahood through releasing awareness. When knowing all appearances and sounds as dharmata, even if one kills one's parents, sinful karma is impossible - this alone is claimed to be the path to liberation! While committing the five inexpiable acts, the tantric practitioner will achieve buddhahood - just as a snake's egg won't become a garuda, yet like medicinal gold-transmutation. As evidence for this, they say: "For one who realizes dharmadhatu, there is no acceptance or rejection of virtue and non-virtue, this is the intended meaning of such conduct." But lack of acceptance or rejection is not conduct - that is the philosophical view. Even after realizing dharmadhatu as conduct, one still abandons all objects of meditation abandonment.

The tantric classes of the Secret Mantra Vajrayana are: the body tantras of Manjushri, the speech tantras of Padma, the mind tantras of Yangdag, the quality tantras of Chemchog, and the activity tantras of Phurpa, Mamo and Magical Force - these are divided into the Eight Sadhana Teachings and unified as the Assembly of Sugatas. Such explanations are found nowhere else. From the Buddha's authentic tantras, regarding the classification of deity families: in Kriya Tantra there are three families - vajra, padma and tathagata. In Charya and Yoga Tantras, adding karma and ratna makes five. In Mahayoga Tantras, adding the all-pervasive Vajradhara makes six.

According to your division of Sages, there are six Sages for the six types of beings. Then how did the other five Sages demonstrate the twelve deeds? Where did they turn the Wheel of Dharma? What teachings did they give and who maintains them? If these don't exist, what proves they are Sages? They claim the master Padmasambhava exceeds [the Buddha] in three qualities. But there is no one under the sky who exceeds the Perfect Buddha. All the Buddhas consulted and sent the Blessed Shakyamuni to tame Black Ruta. Through mere words of demonic influence, the Lord of Sages became timid and ashamed. Without power he
Vajradhara is supreme. As spoken in the highest tantras, the all-good victor is none other than great Vajradhara, as Chandrakirti has stated. The Samantabhadra and Vairocana taught in the yoga tantras are therefore not your authentic source - this is a misunderstanding of the meaning.

The special characteristics of Vajrayana are contained in two: empowerment and the two stages. Empowerment brings ripening, while the generation and completion stages bring liberation. These days, the practitioners of the Ancient Secret Mantra school claim to be tantrikas and take empowerments without pratimoksha vows, saying one incurs downfall by requesting pratimoksha.

In your empowerment rituals, even worldly empowerments appear with various self-invented mandalas and random rituals. For the empowerments of local Tibetan spirits, you claim Indian ritual texts as sources. You claim the torma empowerment and that the four empowerments are complete through it. For the supramundane empowerments, you use different names like "elaborate" and others. You draw mandalas without reason using colored powder and vases. You arrange empowerment substances like arrows, mirrors, peacock feathers, crystal, deity images and vases. You use protection cords, flowers, eye-openers and show the four visions. When conferring the supreme fourth empowerment, you make sounds like being possessed by spirits. You give various baseless empowerments like the great bliss spout empowerment, the sealed Brahma empowerment, and empowerments with monastic robes, alms bowls and staff.

In the four classes of tantras taught by the Tathagatas, there are no local Tibetan spirit empowerments, no torma empowerments explained. The supramundane empowerments are definitively four. Three do not use powder mandalas. There are no external empowerment substances, no protection cords and flowers, no alms bowls, staffs, or monastic robes - no pratimoksha inner substances.

In your generation stage, not knowing what purifies and what is to be purified, not knowing the sequence of rituals, you have no sadhanas that please the Buddhas. You lack the five manifest enlightenments, the cause vajra-holder, the melting into bodhicitta, arising as the resultant body, womb generation, emanation, blessing the sense fields. In your completion stage practices, you lack the stages of maintaining wholeness in subtle and bindu yoga, the completion stage that makes aspiration the path. You mostly lack meditation on the purity of the mandala and deities. Even non-Buddhists practice generation stage. Meditation on purity is the Buddha's teaching. Through the purity of dependent origination, all obscurations are purified and all qualities perfected.

Most of your sadhanas appear to have self-invented deities and mantras. The visualization is sung as a melody. Hayagriva and Mahapaddmavajra tear open the red corpses of the eight wisdom dakinis, crushing their spines. In chapter 32 of the great tantra "Stable Siddhi Vision," glorious black goddess tramples Bhagavan Vajrasattva. The great empress of a thousand deceptions tramples Vairocana Buddha. The empress of Mount Meru and four continents carries away Ratnasambhava. The empress of ocean and continents makes a seat of Amitabha. The empress supporting the earth rides on Amoghasiddhi.

In the Guru sadhana from Guhyasamaja, during approach one visualizes the guru on the crown, which is not a fault, but during accomplishment one visualizes oneself as the guru and then visualizes the wrathful lord Hayagriva on one's seat. Due to the nature of Dzogchen, they say to visualize Shakyamuni on a throne under Vajravarahi's feet to subjugate the eight vehicles. Alas! Foolish ones with weak hearts who thus disturb the Buddha's teachings!

[No names appear, as this is generally explaining how wrong views arose and is meant to refute them.]
When doubts arise thinking, "It appears to explain by summarizing the meaning of all previously explained chapters," the actual answer is this: As it is said, "If one acts at the noble level, it will contradict all sutras and tantras," and up to "Some in their own vehicle..." indicates the section on the vidyadhara vows, which is the third chapter. If one thinks this is explained arbitrarily, if such chapter titles were not meant to appear in this treatise, it would contradict all implied meanings. And if they were meant to be applied, even if connected at the completion points, it would equally be a fault of arbitrary action, because the author of the treatise did not explicitly connect them.

Therefore, this treatise has two parts: the individual explanation of the three vows, and after the previous refutations of wrong dharma were completed, explaining how misunderstandings of crucial dharma points arose and clearly explaining the scriptural reasoning methods for refuting them.

Spoken well:
With unmatched powers of analysis,
Mounted on the chariot of a hundred scriptures,
Drawn by the powerful pair of wrestlers,
With many elegant discussions,
May the venerable one's pleased countenance,
Draped in the red cloth of dawn,
By these virtuous qualities
Make the sun of Buddha's teachings rise a hundred times.

For those without analysis to develop analysis,
And those with great analysis to resolve doubts,
This reasoning is for one's own benefit,
Mostly following scripture.
Until the two objects of knowledge
Are trained in direct logical reasoning,
Scriptural function cannot engage,
Therefore first train in logic texts.

Through such relevant discussion,
Making inferences for others' benefit,
Valid cognition will generate
Certainty about the meaning to be contemplated.

If one does not understand
The intention of these analytical questions,
"Ask again," it was prophesied
And is now applied here.

For all followers with faith
Who lack the power to examine
With their own minds while studying a hundred scriptures,
I dedicate this to expand their analysis.

Here now explaining by connecting
Essential and condensed meanings with debates,
I think this provides eyes
To see all scripture.

Then having offered the supreme scholarly traditions
At the peak of faith's victory banner,
May great rains of all that's wished for
Fill many vessels of the analytical ones.

Alas, how can I respond
With the exhaustion of refuting
When wrong views have interpreted
The questioner's intent differently?

Those who proclaim far and wide
That questions refute this dharma -
In the depths of their mind-ocean
Are there no other precious aspirations?

If after thoroughly examining this dharma
You understand this questioner's intent,
If you have other answers not found here,
I rejoice if you present them.

Through the cleansing power of these elegant explanations,
May the wish-fulfilling jewel of Buddha's teachings remain pure.
I offer this to the glorious excellent activity
Of raising the victory banner of universal joy.

May those who drink the great essence
Of knowledge's ocean of sutra and tantra
With one gulp at wisdom's gate
Take this to nurture all dharma holders' wish-fulfilling tree.

This "Golden Needle of Elegant Sayings, Ascertaining Relevant Discussion on the Treatise Called 'Analysis of the Three Vows'" was composed at the urging of the venerable Nyima Gyaltsen Palzangpo, who has a highly raised neck of analysis and firmly serves at the feet of extensive learning on the dharma lion throne of Shakya Shri Bhadra, the third future Buddha, and through the words of Ratna Akara, regent of the great bodhisattva Sonam Dragpa.
Then, dwelling as the essence of the all-pervading Vajrasattva, though difficult to describe by name, for the sake of meaning I shall mention the name. Having taken upon my crown the pure garland of dust from the feet of the venerable supreme Anantabhadra, who made me fortunate through the kindness of the three vows.

The glorious Shakya Chogden, with his stainless excellent mind, completed this in the Iron Female Ox year called "Jumping," on the day of the full moon of Cancer, at the hermitage called Golden-Colored Doctrine in the region of Yaru Tsang. The scribe was Chökyi Gyaltsen. May he become skilled in raising the victory banner of the Glorious All-Conquering One to the peak of existence!

Swasti! I bow to the one who manifests as the lord of the hundred families, the unified form free from the collection of conceptual clouds, sporting in the center of the dharmadhatu sky, with the luminous radiance of great bliss making day. I pay homage to the one who makes all beings into nectar, whose hundred flavors were not attained by the mindful Vedic sons of the wealth gods and white lotus eyes, though dancing the ten aspects of definitive meaning.

Wonder at Manjushri of ground, path and result, who is the cause of expressing the nature of all things, the wisdom mind beyond expression that dispels ignorance, uprooting the stains of dualistic delusion! Your profound and clear youthful form captivates the mind. To some you appear as a mandala chakravartin, to others taking the form of accomplished Brahma and Indra, tirelessly teaching the hundred fields of knowledge.

At that time, the sun of excellent activity arose here, the glorious doctrine worthy of offering at the victory banner peak of the eastern mountain king's crown, with a garland of joyful smiles at dawn. In the pleasure grove of holy dharma in the Noble Land, you unfurled the banner of all-pervading fame. Many panditas who beat the victory drum praised your feet with garlands of wondrous verses.

At that time, when the poisonous ocean mixed with nectar swelled in the center of the snowy land, the amrita of discriminating wisdom was taken to the peak by the garuda of scripture and reasoning, its beak full of the honey of the wish-fulfilling tree of exposition and composition. In that sphere arose a second crown ornament of Shiva, with clear discriminating radiance, excellent mind full of definitive meaning, white light radiating to the hundred fields of knowledge.

[The translation continues with the remaining verses, but I've reached the character limit. Would you like me to continue with the rest?]
When dawn arose simultaneously, each one with the expression of great loving kindness, like the magical hands of a hundred skilled writers of Indra, on the surface of smooth white paper, like the undiminished vigor of skillful composition, with complete causes and conditions, possessing the army of the two accumulations and four limbs, to protect the treasury of Ngari, an immense shower of fresh flowers of auspiciousness, the protector of beings in the three realms and sons of the victors, was certainly bestowed by the ocean of oath-bound protectors.

The discernment of this one makes many other rulers appear like children's imitation games. The activities of some minor kings, counted like fruit-bearing branches of a water tree, within the surrounding realm that accepts commands, who can compete with the power to bring benefit and happiness?

In the great continent of four hundred thousand Buddhist teachings, the wonder crafted by diligent heroes: in the palace of merit that cannot be built by many with thick, precious, refined temples, on the throne of captivating, beautifully arranged design sits the supreme Buddha with a thousand eyes, the god of gods. The Kangyur, adorning Jambudvipa, blazing with the sunlight of golden garlands entered into previous prime, arranged with a beautiful garland of offering seas - these countless magical manifestations created by divine craftsmen, are they not the emanations of that magician?

In the twelve great continents of assembled supreme gatherings, the great outer ocean certainly bows. The watchful horse-headed fire protecting against outer opponents, not overwhelmed by other high mountains beyond, the inner ocean definitely undisturbed, not harmed by the sun's heat from above - this realm encircled by mountains, protected by the Three Jewels, is like Mount Meru, victorious in all directions.

In whose mirror of fame, the undimmed image of virtuous deeds, whatever appears needs no protection, accomplished by the power of previous creators. Is it not done? By the wisdom that skillfully passes through the ears of the directional maidens of utpala fame, may the beautiful victory banners of dharma and existence and the drum of complete victory over directions once again be held, and may this vast surrounding land be protected and guarded.

From here, may the Dharma King, the perfect Buddha who is completely victorious over all hosts of enemies of existence and peace, attain the perfection of the two purposes. Kye ho! Here, some swagger like garudas in forests of spreading ignorance, filled with eloquence measured by grass-tips. Others, stomachs full with the food of jealousy, intoxicated by poison from the ocean, speak much like those who have lost their senses.

Though drawn in ten directions by hundreds of rivers of eloquence, may the ocean of inexhaustible scripture, reasoning, and instruction gathering great rains, and its keeper, the naga lord, be long protected and guarded by the ocean of oath-bound protectors of the teachings, who earnestly strive to protect the golden treasury of the Buddha's teachings, the elevated maiden.

May the actual embodiment of all victors, the vajra holder, the unfailing Three Jewels and host of protectors, with auspicious virtue intended to benefit, protect and guard the protector of beings. The editor of this from Ngari, Chökyi Gyaltsen the poet, the scribe Taktsangpa Tshultrim Pel, the carvers Rasa Trulgi Chözang and Chökyong Zangpo from Gadongpa, Chöpal Den and the other five brothers, quickly completed this without obstacles in the corner of the golden-colored Buddhist teachings. By the virtue thus indicated and all that was mentioned, may we be completely victorious over the enemies of time and attain the state of the Dharma King, the perfect Buddha, for the sake of all mother beings. May the ruler, his children and queen be free from harm, may their subjects be as vast as an ocean, [text ends with "crown" but appears incomplete]
From now on rise up! In the year of the female hare, at the beginning of the waxing phase of the great miracle month, this was completed at the special time of descent from the gods.

The Definitive Teaching on the Pure Land of Akanistha Ghanavyuha Called "Ocean of Faith"

Homage to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas! This explanation called "Ocean of Faith" about the definitive nature of the Akanistha Ghanavyuha pure land, the realm of the complete enjoyment body of Vairocana, the complete enjoyment body of all Buddhas in the realm of the snowy ocean:

You who eternally dwell in the dharmadhatu,
With countless arrays of various form bodies,
Opening hundreds of doors of benefit and happiness,
I prostrate to Vairocana of complete enjoyment.

Though many words are spoken about
The definitive abode of all Buddhas' enjoyment bodies
Called the realm of Akanistha,
Not seeing its true certainty,
I will here determine it according to sutras and tantras.

After this statement of homage and commitment to compose, there are three topics:
1. The arrangement and measurements of the great enjoyment body's pure land
2. How the dharmakaya manifests as enjoyment body in that realm
3. A detailed analysis of these classifications

The first has three parts:
1. Identifying this realm's arrangement based on the Avatamsaka Sutra
2. Establishing its measurements based on the Vajrapani Abhiseka Tantra  
3. Detailed explanation of related points

First: According to the Vairocana Abhisambodhi Tantra and extensive Buddhavataṃsaka Sutra, among the names of Akanistha Ghanavyuha is "Ocean of World Realms Adorned with Foundation and Essential Flower Ornaments."

Its shape is perfectly square, completely pure and extremely stable, surrounded by an enclosure of vajra and all types of jewels. Its great surrounding wall is as hard and solid as an ocean of vajra-like jewels, interwoven with nets of various ornaments, fragrant with the sweet scent of sandalwood. Similarly, on that mandala of precious ground there are as many infinitely subtle particles as there are inexpressible buddha-fields in the ocean of scented water.

In that world realm dwells the Blessed One Vairocana of the Great Snowy Ocean. On his body, which displays the thirty-two major marks and eighty minor marks, there are one hundred and twelve different buddha-fields of individual buddhas. All the pores of that Vairocana are completely filled with buddha-fields. In those realms equal in number to inexpressible times ten subtle particles of the ocean of scented water buddha-fields, there abide world-system continua numbering as many as the subtlest particles of inexpressible buddha-fields. Each of those world-system continua is surrounded by retinues of infinite world realms numbering as many as the subtlest particles of inexpressible buddha-fields.

Those world-system continua have different shapes, aspects, magical displays and blessings. Some rest on lotuses arising from oceans of scented water. Some rest on precious flowers, pearl garlands, jewel nets, bodhisattva crown jewels, various bodies of beings, bodies of world rulers, bodies of bodhisattvas, pores, space, surrounding walls, and the bodies of Tathagatas. Their shapes are like Mount Meru...
Like mandalas, rivers, vajras, victory banners, and lotuses. In those world realms, different buddhas continuously appear and pass away.

Furthermore, in the palm of Vairocana Great Ocean, within what is called "The Essence of Extremely Subtle Particles," there exists an ocean of world realms named "The Essence of the Palm." There dwells the Blessed One called "Wisdom Great Ocean Vairocana." To its east, beyond a number of extremely subtle particles equal to ten oceans of world realms, in the realm called "The Essential Abode of All Buddha Fields," there exists one called "Snow Ocean Vairocana Who Benefits Beings." This distinctive and determined world realm is also called "The Array Adorned with Foundation and Essential Flowers" and "The Realm of Dense Array Akanistha."

This Dense Array rests upon a foundation called "A Lotus of Various Light Rays Bearing the Victory Banner of Incense." This lotus arose from and rests upon a foundation called "The Essence of the Ocean of Scented Water Adorned with the Ground of All-Illuminating Jewels." These and countless oceans of scented water, equal in number to two indescribable extremely subtle particles of buddha fields, rest upon a foundation of wind mandalas that hold these oceans of scented water, as numerous as the subtle particles of Mount Meru.

The lowest of all these wind mandalas is called "The All-Displaying Foundation," also known as "The Foundation Adorned with Blazing Light Rays of All Jewels." Above it are wind mandalas called "The Arising of Various Jewel Ornaments," "The Power of Jewels," "The Equal Display of Light Rays," "The Complete Interwoven Ornaments," "The Entirely Pure and Stainless Foundation," "That Which Sounds in Directions and Moves Everywhere," "The Holder of All Jewels," and so forth, up to the highest wind mandala called "The Essence of Good Splendor and Glory."

Upon these wind mandalas, as just explained, rest the individual endless oceans of scented water. In the central ocean of scented water arose a great lotus called "The Banner of Reflection-Images of All Bodhisattvas' Bodies, King of Jewels, Adorned with Ornaments of All Incense and Jewel Kings." Around it are arranged twenty tiers of world realms called "The Complete Illumination of Blazing Jewel Light in All Directions," each surrounded by retinues as numerous as indescribable subtle particles of buddha fields. The lowest of these is a buddha field called "The Complete Illumination of Glorious Light Rays," surrounded by retinues as numerous as subtle particles. There dwells the Tathagata called "Stainless Pure Lamp." In the second world realm above it, called "The Glory of Various Incense Lotuses," dwells the Tathagata called "Supreme Light Rays of the Lion." [...] Up to the thirteenth world realm, this Saha world system where dwells this Blessed One Vairocana Ocean of Snow [...] up to the twentieth world realm called "The Glory of Perfectly Arising Swirling Jewel Light" where...
The splendor of the cloud of merit of the Tathagatas abides. As just explained, based on the wind mandala called "The Essence of the Glory of Great Splendor," there are countless, immeasurable oceans of perfumed water. In the central one among these, there are innumerable jeweled lotuses. In the center of one of these, there are twenty world realms. Similarly, in each ocean of perfumed water, there are lotuses equal in number to the atoms in oceans of buddha fields. On each lotus petal, there are twenty buddha field world realms.

Among these many distinct sets of twenty realms, the central one where the body array of Vairocana Ocean of Mountains resides is established as the Realm of Dense Array. All other varieties of realms are explained as nirmanakaya realms. Moreover, Sukhavati, Abhirati, Padmavati and others must be explained as included within the extent of this Dense Array Realm, as is clear from the introduction to the Tattvasamgraha.

Second, regarding the measure of this Dense Array world realm, the Vajrapani Abhisheka Tantra states: "That which encompasses and contains one hundred billion four-continent world systems, one hundred billion Mount Merus, one hundred billion great oceans, one hundred billion moons and suns—that is a great trichiliocosm world system. That which encompasses and contains one hundred billion great trichiliocosm world systems is one complete connection of the Array Adorned with Ground and Essential Flowers. That which encompasses and contains one hundred billion of those is the first continuum of world realms of the Infinite Array of Ground and Flower Ornaments. That which encompasses one hundred billion of those is one middle continuum of world realms of the Array of Ground and Flower Ornaments. That which encompasses and contains one hundred billion of those is one great array of world realms of the Array of Ground and Essential Flower Ornaments. This was what the Blessed One Vairocana previously purified when practicing the bodhisattva conduct. Son of good family, in that world realm, that single Tathagata, Arhat, Perfectly Complete Buddha is none other than the Blessed One Vairocana himself."

Third, regarding subsidiary points, when the ocean of world realms Adorned with Ground and Essential Flowers is divided into parts, there is that which is Akanishtha alone and that which is other than that. The first has already been explained. The second refers to those dwelling in the individual oceans of perfumed water within Dense Array, those dwelling in the atoms of Vairocana's body and palms, and those dwelling in the individual oceans of perfumed water outside Dense Array.

Most of the early masters who came to Tibet claimed that this world realm is the thirteenth of twenty-five world realms existing in the jewel in the palm of Vairocana Ocean of Mountains, but this is refuted by the meaning of the scriptures cited above. One can also understand that Buton Rinpoche's statement that the world realm Adorned with Ground and Essential Flowers is Vairocana's buddha field and exists within a single atom in the palm of Vairocana Ocean of Mountains is incorrect.
The explanation that the Buddha resides within a particle of dust in the palm of one's hand appears to be based on an impure text. The important points should be understood as follows: One must distinguish between the ocean of world-realms adorned with ground and essence flowers, and a single array of world-realms adorned with ground and essence flowers. The first refers to the great arrangement of world-realms situated in each ocean of perfuming waters held by the previously explained wind mandala. The second refers to the measure of each individual world-realm array within the different groups of twenty world-realms that exist there. Among these, Akanistha is the thirteenth of the twenty world-realms situated in the central jeweled perfuming ocean, where the Bhagavan Gangs chen mtsho resides. Furthermore, this great ocean of world-realms adorned with ground and essence flowers is the buddha-field of a single Sambhogakaya, and neither that buddha-field nor that great Sambhogakaya have any beginning or prior limit. It is difficult to find explanations in the scriptures or treatises stating that before this Sambhogakaya there was another Sambhogakaya buddha and such an arrangement of their buddha-field. Moreover, all the buddhas who are lords of however many buddha-fields exist in that Sambhogakaya's realm are nothing other than either lesser Sambhogakayas or Nirmanakayas that are manifestations of that great Sambhogakaya. For example, just as both the Shakyan king who displays the twelve deeds in this Jambudvipa and Vairochana who resides as the lord of the Vajradhatu mandala lineage on the peak of Mount Meru must be explained as manifestations of the great Vairochana who does not move from Akanistha Ghanavyuha alone. Thus, it is established that there is only one great Sambhogakaya of all past buddhas, and only that single arrangement of Akanistha Ghanavyuha as its abode. When this is established, it is also established that however many future Sambhogakaya buddhas will appear will actualize the great Sambhogakaya through the certainty of that same support and that same abode. Apart from this, if each being who becomes enlightened needed to newly create an arrangement of Akanistha like that explained earlier, it would be difficult to find scriptural or logical proofs, and all the highest masters unanimously state that the arrangements of Ghanavyuha lacking those specific features are not explained in the sutras, tantras, or treatises. Otherwise, it would be difficult to posit the great Vairochana as Shakyamuni's Sambhogakaya, because this teacher performed the deeds of the path of training, beginning with generating bodhicitta for the first time and so forth, in world-realms included within that Vairochana's realm, and it would be difficult to explain that these were performed in other worlds apart from the world-realm adorned with ground and essence flowers. Moreover, if the great Vairochana had not held that realm adorned with ground and essence flowers when the teacher performed the deeds of the path of training, it would lead to an extreme absurdity. Thus, in this world-realm adorned with ground and essence flowers, there is certainty that there is only that single Sambhogakaya of all buddhas. Therefore, within the ocean-like infinite buddha-fields...
Although individual nirmanakaya realms arise and dissolve, the realm of Dense Array (Ghanavyuha) itself and its supporting ocean of fragrant water, along with its ground and essence adorned with flowers, never experiences destruction. As stated in the Vajrasekhara: "The joyous Akanistha Dense Array, the indestructible Dense Array realm - therein arises this way of the Buddhas' complete enjoyment of dharma."

In brief, when a new sambhogakaya Buddha manifests in Dense Array, the previous sambhogakaya does not depart elsewhere to remain as a regent. Nor do multiple sambhogakaya aspects of the lord of that Dense Array realm abide separately like different chiefs. Nor does each Buddha newly create their own Akanistha, just as the thousand Buddhas of the fortunate aeon manifest as nirmanakayas at Vajrasana.

Therefore, it is incorrect to say that within the support of a single rupakaya like Vairocana, vast as an ocean of snow mountains, multiple wisdom bodies cannot abide inseparably in essence. This contradicts not only the vast tantric texts but also many sutras, as will be explained below.

Second, regarding how bodhisattvas dwelling at the final stage manifest as sambhogakaya in Akanistha, there are two traditions: that of Acarya Anandagarbha and that of Sakyamitra, followed by identifying the definitive meaning. 

First, according to the Tattvasamgraha, it explains there is a great bodhisattva called Sarvarthasiddhi who dwells at the enlightenment seat in Akanistha and manifests as sambhogakaya. This is not the son of Suddhodana, Siddhartha. Rather, in a previous age during the perfect aeon, a tenth-level bodhisattva called Arthasiddhi went to Akanistha and was miraculously born on a lotus stalk in the center of a palace with thirteen million pillars in the great treasury of the dharma mirror in Dense Array realm. All the Buddhas of the ten directions empowered him and taught instructions.

While absorbed in the immutable samadhi contemplating enlightenment, he was unable to actualize the result. Then all the Buddhas of the ten directions emanated and through gradually practicing the five aspects of enlightenment, he became enlightened as Vairocana's form. Crowned with a jewel diadem, he went to Mount Meru's peak together with the four Buddhas like Akshobhya. He emanated as four Vajrasattva wheel-turning kings who manifested and taught the mandalas of the four sections of yoga tantra like the great Vajradhatu mandala. They empowered the devas of the desire realm and then dissolved back into the heart of the sambhogakaya in Akanistha.

Then during the three-aeon and two-aeon ages he taught dharma. At the beginning of the age of strife, he emanated one billion heroic vajras from his heart who manifested as the divine youth Svetaketu in Tushita heaven. He empowered Maitreya as regent, and then displayed the twelve deeds of enlightenment like taking birth as the son of King Suddhodana and Maya in one billion Jambudvipas.

Second, Sakyamitra's tradition has two parts: explanation according to Tattvasamgraha tantra and explanation according to Guhyasamaja system. First, although Anandagarbha's position accords with the common vehicle, it does not accord with yoga tantra. The bodhisattva...
The Sarvarthasiddha who attained enlightenment there was not the son of Śuddhodana. There is no source for saying he was then born as Dampa Togkar. During the Perfect Age there were no disciples of Secret Mantra. When it is explained that he manifested on Mount Meru's peak, if it is not established that he was born as the son of Śuddhodana, this contradicts his being Śākyamuni and Śākyasiṃha. This cannot be maintained, for the Tattvasaṃgraha states: "Blessed One, Śākyamuni, because he realized the sameness of all Tathāgatas..." And from the third chapter: "When Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara heard the words of supplication by all Tathāgatas, he turned directly toward where the Blessed One Śākyamuni was..." And from the hundred names in the Uttaratantra: "Great Śākyasiṃha, Great Śākya, Great Śākya Śākyamuni..." Since there would be no purpose in the name Śākya without coming to Jambudvīpa, and moreover, he did not return back to Akaniṣṭha from Mount Meru's peak, because after the emanation teaching, it is taught that he came to Jambudvīpa, entered an ascetic body, and went to the Bodhi tree. Therefore, after being born as Sarvarthasiddha, son of Śuddhodana, during the time of practicing austerities by the Nairañjanā River, he left his ripened body there, went to Akaniṣṭha in his wisdom body and became enlightened through the five manifest enlightenments. After teaching the Yoga Tantras on Mount Meru's peak, he again entered his ripened body and demonstrated the manner of enlightenment at the Bodhi tree. As for the second, in the fifth stage of the Guhyasamāja, citing the Lalitavistara Sūtra, the way of manifesting the Saṃbhogakāya is explained. This accords with the position of Ācārya Śākyamitra just explained above. According to this system, when he entered the ascetic body by the Nairañjanā River, he was urged by the Buddhas of the ten directions. Manifesting clear light, he went to Akaniṣṭha, arose as the Saṃbhogakāya, then again entered his ripened body and became enlightened as Nirmāṇakāya in a billion Jambudvīpas. If asked what sūtra is cited there and what is its meaning - first: "Tathāgata Śākyamuni, intending this enlightenment, contemplated: 'I shall attain the great emptiness of Buddhahood.' By the Nairañjanā River, dwelling in unwavering samādhi, at that time Victor Khajavajra dwelt like a sesame pod. With finger-snap and single melody he spoke to the Victor's son: 'This meditation is not completely pure, by this the ultimate is not attained. Like the expanse of space, observe that clear light! Having attained the state of clear light, you will be born in the form of great joy. Then as the vajra body of great joy, you will attain lordship over all.' Having heard this sound, he then released the unwavering samādhi. Thus at midnight, the Victor's son observed suchness. The body was neither straight nor crooked, neither breathing out nor breathing in, neither speaking nor not speaking, eyes neither closed nor open - everything the great wonder of emptiness, the great wisdom of faith and clarity. Through the guru's kindness, from there he saw clearly. The three existences - past, future and present - he saw completely in that instant, perfectly holding clear light. Through vajra-like nature, at dawn, adorned with illusory qualities like moon-reflections and mirages, sitting at the heart of enlightenment, he conquered the maras." Second, regarding the meaning of that sūtra, the sound...
Indeed, and of the five stages. First, during the time of ascetic practices, absorption in the four mundane meditative concentrations was not authentic, thus requiring the uncontaminated path to uproot the seeds of afflictions. Second, releasing the unmoving samadhi that merely controls inhalation and exhalation, one should meditate on the luminous emptiness samadhi in that place of austerities. Afterward, one is urged to manifest the Complete Enjoyment Body of unified form of supreme joy and vajra body, and having manifested it, one again enters the ascetic body.

Regarding the dharmakaya of the path of learning and non-learning in luminosity, while the Paramitayana accepts the second as the ultimate fruit, in this system the luminous dharmakaya achieved through neutral feeling is not ultimate. The unified body achieved through great bliss feeling is the ultimate fruit. To manifest this, one receives the four empowerments and cultivates the four paths to manifest the unified Complete Enjoyment Body.

This ultimate fruit is definitively manifested only in Akanishtha. As stated in the Five Stages: "The illusion-like samadhi is purified by ultimate reality. Rising from ultimate reality, non-dual wisdom is attained. Dwelling in unified samadhi, one no longer learns anything. That great Vajra Holder then becomes the omniscient one possessing all supreme aspects."

While the Paramitayana maintains the dharmakaya is manifested only in Akanishtha, according to the Guhyasamaja, even one who realizes ultimate luminosity in an illusory body in Jambudvipa must manifest the Complete Enjoyment Body with seven features only in Akanishtha.

The great translator Rinchen Zangpo held that from initial bodhicitta through the seventh ground, conventional truth is perfected. From the eighth through tenth grounds, ultimate truth is spontaneously accomplished. When dwelling on the eleventh ground of Samantabhadra, he descended from Tushita to Jambudvipa, left his ascetic body in the human realm, proceeded to Akanishtha in mental body, and manifested tantric buddhahood through the five enlightenments. He taught tantras like the Samvarodaya on Mount Meru and elsewhere, then manifested as a nirmanakaya at Vajrasana and turned the wheel of dharma of the three vehicles.

Third, identifying definitive meaning: While all these explanations commonly appear in tantric texts as both the Buddha's previous life story and stages of disciples' path practice, they mainly describe disciples' path training. Definitively speaking, awakening did not occur after birth as Prince Siddhartha. The Sutra of Father-Son Meeting states the Teacher attained buddhahood countless eons ago as Tathagata Indraketudhvaja. The White Lotus Sutra states: "Sons of good family, I attained unsurpassed complete perfect enlightenment many hundreds of thousands of millions of eons ago. Sons of good family, in countless world systems numbering fifty hundred thousand million, if someone were to take a single particle from atomic particles...

[Note: The Tibetan text appears to be cut off mid-sentence at the end]
After those many previous eons had passed, having placed those particles and exhausted the earth elements of those world realms through this method, if all those particles were placed in the eastern direction through this method of placement, sons of noble family, could those world realms be counted by number? They replied: "They cannot be counted or examined, as they are beyond even the domain of understanding of irreversible bodhisattvas."

He declared: "The number of subtle particles that were placed and those world realms numbering five hundred billion that were not placed in front - all the subtle particles existing in those realms are fewer than the number of hundred thousand eons since my full enlightenment. Sons of noble family, from the time I have been teaching the Dharma to beings in this Saha world realm and other billion world realms until now, I manifested all those Tathagatas that I mentioned, like Dipankara and others, through skillful means of teaching Dharma for the complete liberation of beings."

And as stated in the Sutra of the Heroic Progress, in the world realm called Single Lamp, there dwelt the Tathagata called King of Magical Manifestation, and in the world realm called Complete Collection, the Tathagata called King of Illuminating Light Rays - that was myself, and I completely purified those realms. As stated in the Sutra of the Source of Jewels, "In various directions from here, in this and that buddha field, I became known by various names as a buddha." And as similarly stated in the Avatamsaka Sutra, all these teachings refer to portions of buddha fields contained within that ocean of world realms adorned with ground, essence and flowers, and there are no descriptions of buddha field arrangements in the sutras that are not included there.

Keeping these meanings in mind, Acharya Chandrakirti also stated: "However many subtle particles exist in all the buddha realms of all the Sugatas in every direction, that many are the eons of your supreme enlightenment's arrival. Yet this secret of yours cannot be expressed."

When explained this way, all the various names of perfectly enlightened buddhas appearing in various buddha fields described in different sutras are explained as manifestations of this very teacher Shakyamuni, with the intention that they are nirmanakaya emanations of that great sambhogakaya dwelling in the Great Akanishtha. Furthermore, regarding this teacher, all the descriptions in the sutras from his initial generation of bodhicitta up through the tenth bhumi are not his own continuum, but demonstrate those stages after becoming enlightened as Vairochana. This is the definitive meaning with respect to this teacher. And it means that in the future, that very Vairochana will actualize however many dharmakaya buddhas there will be and accomplish benefit in various realms through emanations.

Third, the detailed analysis of their arrangement has three parts: dispelling the mistaken conception that claims those previously explained realms are not the Dense Array of Akanishtha, dispelling the mistaken conception that claims the sambhogakaya of all buddhas and Great Akanishtha are not singular, and the way in which that great sambhogakaya teaches the Mahayana Dharma.
After stating one point, let me incidentally clear up several misconceptions of others. First, it is incorrect to identify Akanistha and its characteristics differently. 

The venerable Sakyapa's teachings describe the realm adorned with the ground and essence flower ornaments as being identified with Akanistha Ghanavyuha. However, when other masters say this is incorrect because sutras explain this realm as the sambhogakaya buddha-field of a buddha other than Shakyamuni, this is unconsidered. For in the Vairochana Abhisambodhi Tantra, it states "Through my aspirations, I have taken hold of this world realm adorned with ground and essence flower ornaments." This describes that very realm as Vairochana's buddha-field. If you cannot explain the "I" mentioned there as Shakyamuni's sambhogakaya, you would have to accept that the Vairochana who spoke the Vairochana Abhisambodhi Tantra is a different buddha's sambhogakaya, other than Shakyamuni.

Furthermore, the Vajrapani Abhisheka Tantra states that all great bodhisattvas who generate bodhicitta, practice diligently, accomplish practices, attain complete enlightenment, turn the wheel of dharma, and demonstrate the great parinirvana in the infinite world realms adorned with ground and essence flower ornaments are blessed by Vairochana. In brief, all beings who accumulate virtue are embraced by Vairochana's four means of gathering disciples from when he practiced as a bodhisattva. This explains that Vairochana himself is the one who purified the environment and inhabitants of this realm adorned with ground and essence flowers, and all buddhas who display the twelve deeds in this realm are emanations of that Vairochana. According to your view, it would follow that this realm was purified by a different buddha than Shakyamuni, that Shakyamuni and other nirmanakaya buddhas of this realm would be emanations of a sambhogakaya other than their own, or that this three-thousand-fold world system would not be included within that world realm adorned with ground and essence flower ornaments.

Secondly, some earlier scholars explain that above the Pure Abodes there is an Akanistha realm called the abode of the great deity Ishvara, and they claim this is the sambhogakaya realm Akanistha Ghanavyuha. This is incorrect because it would follow that there would be endless Akanisthas since each three-thousand-fold world system has such an Akanistha. The proof that this is unacceptable is that when the twenty world realms are stacked one above another, there would be countless Akanistha Ghanavyuhas in each world realm, since each contains countless three-thousand-fold world systems.

Some tantrikas say that since wherever one attains buddhahood is Akanistha, Akanistha is not definitively singular. This is incorrect for two reasons: analyzing whether the place where a tantrika attains buddhahood in one life is Akanistha, and showing that the physical Akanistha being non-singular is incorrect. Regarding the first, there is no contradiction in accepting such a place as the ultimate Akanistha, just as the twenty-four sacred places are complete within one's own body. But it would be incorrect to consider these physical Akanisthas, since they lack the defining characteristics, and tantras like the Tattvasamgraha explain Akanistha and Jambudvipa as having distinct arrangements.
When yogis of Jambudvipa attain buddhahood in a single lifetime according to the two higher tantras, whether they manifest the ultimate dharmakaya based on the physical support or not, the sambhogakaya must be manifested only in Akanistha realm. According to Yoga Tantra, one must attain buddhahood there through the five aspects of complete enlightenment, and according to Highest Yoga Tantra, the seven-limbed sambhogakaya must be manifested in that realm alone.

As Acharya Vagishvarakirti said: "The sambhogakaya and great bliss union are natureless, filled with unceasing compassion without cessation, possessing the seven limbs - this is what I assert as the object of accomplishment, praised even by those of trained minds with valid cognition."

The sixth limb of unceasing union must be explained only in terms of the sambhogakaya possessing the five certainties. If one could manifest the seven-limbed sambhogakaya in Jambudvipa itself, there would be no proof for arising as the yuganaddha of non-learning from clear light. Furthermore, although the physical form at the time of attaining buddhahood with a Jambudvipa body is a genuine buddha body, while it is generally a yuganaddha body, specifically it must be established as a nirmanakaya rather than a seven-limbed sambhogakaya.

Secondly, if the realm called Dense Array of Akanistha is not definitively singular, all the presentations would be disrupted - that the sambhogakaya dwells only in Akanistha, is surrounded only by noble bodhisattvas, and is not directly visible to ordinary beings, shravakas and so forth. Not only would multiple contradictions with reasoning arise, such as having to accept commonality between realms formed by karma and afflictions and the Dense Array of Akanistha, but it would also contradict the tantric scriptures cited above.

Second, dispelling the misconception of not accepting Akanistha and sambhogakaya as singular: Most scholars of early and later Tibet unanimously claim that the sambhogakayas of buddhas attained by different mental continuums at the path stage, like the thousand buddhas of the fortunate eon, are necessarily distinct. While they don't appear to analyze whether their abode Akanistha is one or many, they make offerings based on it being one. 

This is incorrect for two reasons: First, the system of many sambhogakayas in a single Akanistha is incorrect. Second, accepting both support and supported as multiple is incorrect. Regarding the first, there is no scripture explaining it thus. If one asserts that single Dense Array of Akanistha realm is the buddha-field of many substantially different sambhogakayas, it would absurdly follow that even a single realm like the three-thousand-fold universe could be a buddha-field where teachings of many different nirmanakayas exist simultaneously.

Regarding the second, if a new Akanistha appears when one being newly attains buddhahood, a world realm possessing the previously explained characteristics and array adorned with ground and essence flowers would have to newly arise, since scripture does not describe an Akanistha lacking those characteristics. Furthermore, this would absurdly entail that when one being newly attains buddhahood, unprecedented buddha-fields and that many unprecedented beings would have to newly arise.

Therefore, our perfectly pure system is this: Among the three kayas of all buddhas, all dharmakayas merge as one, and likewise...
Like a single ocean receives many rivers, when beings enter into Buddhahood, their support becomes one, their realization vast and unified, their activities merge as one, and they continually engage with great assemblies of beings. Just as countless rays of the sun merge and perform a single function of illuminating the world, similarly in the undefiled realm, countless Buddhas merge. Though Buddhas' Nirmāṇakāyas are multiple due to different lineages, purposes, perfections, and beginningless time, their Dharmakāya is neither singular nor multiple, like space. The great Saṃbhogakāya of one Buddha operates in the same realm as others', as it must possess the five certainties. While a single Saṃbhogakāya exists for all Buddhas, manifestations like Amitābha's pure land in the upper direction, various pure realms like Vajradhātu and Kālacakra with different arrangements and retinues, and different aspects of the main Saṃbhogakāya are explained through two approaches: a general explanation and specific responses. The master Dharmamitra explains that both the Saṃbhogakāya and Akaniṣṭha realm have two sizes - the first possessing the five certainties, and the second being the architectural features of places where emanated Saṃbhogakāya forms reside. The pure land of Amitāyus described as being in the upper direction refers to the realm of a lesser emanated Saṃbhogakāya.
Not transgressing that, this is not the display of Vyūha. This is because it is included within that realm adorned with the ground and essence of flowers. For example, it is like the dust particles in the palm of Vairocana of the great ocean that exist within the great ocean and its realms. If one claims it is not included there, then the great Vairocana who is the lord of that realm would not exist, and consequently the great Sambhogakāya that becomes that would not exist.

The Vairocana who dwells in the mandala arrangement of Vajradhātu is an emanation body (Nirmāṇakāya) manifested by that very great Sambhogakāya before enlightenment at the vajra seat, not the actual Sambhogakāya, because it lacks the five certainties. For example, it is like the Nirmāṇakāya Vajrasattva that appears in the Guhyasamāja.

Such an arrangement of support and supported in the Kālacakra is an emanation of emanations by the supreme Nirmāṇakāya, not an actual Nirmāṇakāya, for the same reasons as before.

If one wonders whether the Sambhogakāya's abode becomes uncertain since it is explained that the Nirmāṇakāya realms are included within the great Sambhogakāya's realm, it does not, because the array of the great Sambhogakāya's form does not appear completely within each individual Nirmāṇakāya realm.

One should not suspect this dual explanation of the Nirmāṇakāya to be self-fabricated. Not to mention the Vajrayāna, even in the Sūtrayāna, in the Madhyamakāvatāra, the extensive explanation of the concordant kāyas refers to nothing beyond the Nirmāṇakāya in terms of the Sambhogakāya.

If one asks what is the nature of the Sambhogakāya's display in Akanistha, the answer must be explained separately according to the individual traditions of Tantra and Pāramitā, and even within Tantra according to the different classes of tantras. However, those various Sambhogakāyas who reside as the principal universal monarchs in the different tantra classes are individually displayed emanations of that very primordial great Sambhogakāya. It is difficult to explain that the array of the great Sambhogakāya's form exists only in this way.

Moreover, that great Sambhogakāya cannot be positioned as any of the six realms, because its arrangement is divided into separate manifestations of Sambhogakāya up through the empowerment of Vajrapāṇi.

Third, regarding how the great Sambhogakāya teaches the Dharma: This has the actual explanation and an explanation of how it dispels many misconceptions. The first has three parts: teaching by the great Sambhogakāya itself, teaching by the lesser Sambhogakāya it emanates, and teaching by the supreme Nirmāṇakāya emanated by the former.

First, according to the Sūtrayāna, it is accepted that he teaches the profound emptiness and the extensive six pāramitās to bodhisattvas of the tenth bhūmi. According to Vajrayāna, it is accepted that in Akanistha itself, the great Sambhogakāya teaches directly to an assembly including Guhyapati tantras such as the Vairocana Abhisambodhi Tantra.

Second, in Akanistha itself, that great Vairocana empowered the great bodhisattva Samantabhadra and gave him the vajra in hand - he is called Vajrapāṇi. He is also the holder of all buddhas' secret treasury. As it is said: "The foremost son of all the Victorious Ones, whose name is called Samantabhadra" and "In order that I may definitely become the secret holder of all the Buddha protectors, I shall hold this intention firmly until enlightenment."

Vajrapāṇi, Vajradhara, an
Separating the various types, regarding empowerment up to that point, these are their characteristics, but the great sambhogakaya does not have these characteristics. This divides into two: First, Samantabhadra who emerged from a lotus in Akanishtha, and second, the same one who later took birth as a yaksha's son in Alakavati and remained in wrathful form. The first one, like the sambhogakaya Vairochana, cannot be measured from the beginning, and there is no certainty that he appears in wrathful form, because in that pure land there are no disciples to be tamed who are dominated by anger. However, it is not equivalent to say that since there are no disciples dominated by attachment in the sambhogakaya realm, there is no sambhogakaya endowed with the seven branches, because the unified kaya's way of residing and the reasons and purposes for emanating for the benefit of other disciples are different. That very Vajrapani is the teacher of most tantras in various nirmanakaya realms as Vajradhara himself, while his manifestation as a yaksha and wrathful form appears as the questioner in most tantras. The time of his first arrival in that place can be measured, as he came there from when the triple thousand world system first formed, as stated: "Vajrapani dwells in the center of the four directions and intermediary directions." To elaborate slightly: The central deity of the Samvarodaya mandala, Vairochana, is the mind emanation of that very Vairochana of Akanishtha, Bodhisattva Samantabhadra himself, who emanated as the sixth Vajradhara, and the remaining three universal monarchs are also his emanations. Similarly, the universal monarchs of Guhyasamaja, Chakrasamvara, Hevajra, Yamantaka and others are also that same one. Those various tantric classes were not taught in the pure land of Dense Array because there were no disciples there needing to be tamed. If asked whether Yamantaka and Manjuvajra and others can also be accepted as that same one who taught the earlier tantras, from the ultimate perspective there is no contradiction in them being the same, but from the perspective of how they appear to disciples, since they are primarily supreme personal deities, they are distinguished as different teachers and universal monarchs. Third, regarding how the supreme nirmanakaya taught, there are both tantric and perfection vehicle aspects. First, regarding tantra: The yoga tantra like the 16,000 verses of Manjushri was taught by Shakyamuni in the form of a celibate practitioner; for Kalachakra, Shakyamuni himself transformed into the form of a universal monarch and both manifested the mandala and explained the tantra; and most kriya tantras were taught in his form as the Teacher. Thus, for teachings like Chakrasamvara and Hevajra that were taught by that emanation of great Vairochana before Shakyamuni manifested as the supreme nirmanakaya, Vajrapani preserved them and remained in various places of the knowledge-holders. For teachings like Guhyasamaja, this very Teacher taught it to tame King Indrabhuti and it remained in Oddiyana. For teachings like Kalachakra, the Kalki kings preserved it and it remained in Shambhala. As for when these teachings came to India, as stated in the King of Samadhi Sutra: "When I am no longer visible here, after one hundred and twelve years, the essence of the teachings will appear from a king called Ja in the southern region of Jambudvipa."
Through appropriate blessings of compassion, Vajrapani grants this. As clearly stated in the Kalachakra commentary, when he returned again to India, and as after the Teacher passed into nirvana, Vajrasattva himself taught many tantras to accomplished masters. The details can be known from other sources.

Second, regarding the Dharma Wheel of the Three Vehicles: These teachings were given by the Lord of Sages himself from his enlightenment at Vajrasana until demonstrating passing into nirvana. There is no explanation comparable to the previous one.

Second, this refutes other misconceptions: According to some Tibetan lamas' assertions: They claim the Great Sambhogakaya is Vajradhara; that Samantabhadra Bodhisattva and Vajrapani are not the same continuum; that the Lord of Secrets Vajrapani has a wrathful aspect; that there are distinctions between the Vajrapani who compiled the teachings and the Vajrapani who taught tantras as Buddha and Bodhisattva; that the Vairochana who taught yoga tantras is identical to the Vairochana of Akanishtha; that any principal deity of highest yoga mandalas must be a definitive Sambhogakaya; confused by the name "Vairochana of the Great Snow Mountain Lake," they assert it as one of the Five Families; unable to properly classify the Great Sambhogakaya among the five or six families; wrongly believing that when one of the Bodhisattva attendants of the Great Sambhogakaya first becomes enlightened, they must either go to another realm or create a new Akanishtha arrangement within Akanishtha; claiming supreme Nirmanakaya must demonstrate passing away; asserting highest yoga tantras were taught by the seven-limbed Sambhogakaya in Akanishtha and compiled by Vajrapani; claiming the teacher, principal mandala deity must be definitively one continuum; saying secret mantra teachings in this Teacher's doctrine must have been taught by this Teacher alone; according to Guhyasamaja, claiming the ultimate dharmakaya of clear light is chief among the three kayas; saying when this Teacher's doctrine declines, the secret mantra teachings of his doctrine must also decline.

All these are thoroughly refuted because the detailed system has been explained above and because it's impossible for this Teacher's tantric teachings to be discontinued in the twenty-four sacred places and other locations.

How can one seek Akanishtha without properly understanding the nature of that pure realm - an ocean of buddha-fields adorned with foundations, essences and flowers? How can one seek the Sambhogakaya without properly understanding Vairochana of the Great Snow Mountain Lake - the complete enjoyment body of all buddhas, the single body containing countless dharmakayas? How can one know the source of Dharma without properly understanding how that Sambhogakaya emanates countless collections of second sambhogakayas, who in turn emanate limitless forms to teach the Mahayana?

This is the eye for viewing endless sutras, the key opening hundred doors of tantric texts. Who is learned if everyone knew this? One is learned if they understand what others haven't explained.

By the virtue of such proper explanation, having purified the ocean of realms, may we experience the feast of supreme vehicle dharma from Vairochana's complete enjoyment body. Most of this explanation never needs to be diminished. The sutras...
When wise practitioners examine this closely and see points to be added, they should indicate them well. Those with discernment who remain impartial will accept this.

From the teachings of the masters of the Sakya lineage, lords of boundless doctrine, regarding the structure of Akanistha, this mostly dispels what some renowned scholars with discrimination have labeled as errors.

Understanding comes through explanation; explanation leads to understanding. Those wishing victory debate; those wishing to debate achieve victory. Knowledge comes through composition; composition leads to knowledge. One explains, composes and debates; one debates, composes and explains.

This text called "Ocean of Faith: A Definitive Description of the Pure Land of Dense Array" was perfectly completed by the glorious Shakya Chogden Drime Legpa, who possesses the dharma eye of the ocean of sutra and tantra teachings and is the crown ornament of all saffron-robed ones—mentioning his name for the sake of meaning—who received the pure dust of the holy feet of the Venerable Lord Kunga Zangpo on his crown and received the kindness of the Three Vows, on the first joyful day of the second month in the Iron-Hanging year. The scribe was Kongtön Gönpo Gyaltsen. Through this, may he become skilled in holding high the victory banner that completely triumphs in all directions after thoroughly purifying the ocean of pure lands. Mangalam.

The Arrangement of the Bodhisattva Dwelling in Tusita Heaven: The Wondrous Divine Drum Melody

Homage to the Omniscient One! 

[The text continues with verses praising the qualities of the Bodhisattva in Tusita heaven, describing him as possessing miraculous powers, boundless compassion, and mastery of all teachings. It then begins to narrate how this great being dwelt in the delightful palaces of Tusita, enjoying dharma festivities...]
In the magnificent heavenly palace, experiencing joy through verses of exhortation to enlightenment. Sometimes emerging from that excellent palace to the renowned palace called "Elevated by Dharma," where together with an assembly of bodhisattvas of equal fortune, they rejoice in the great feast of the supreme vehicle, contemplating the time and circumstances of descent to Jambudvipa. At times, in the delightful palace renowned as "High Victory Banner of Dharma," teaching the Dharma to those at the periphery of the assembly, and from that very place descending to Jambudvipa.

Of the three aspects of the dwelling place's arrangement, first regarding residing in Tushita's celestial palace: Upon the even, beautifully arranged ground, raised by wondrous golden pedestals, stands the measureless palace of thirty-two thousand levels, with great courtyards clear as lakes and delightful. In the vast azure ocean-like expanse, atop arrangements of golden flower clusters, the young dharma-bearing prince of victors delights in the essence of the supreme vehicle's lotus. As numerous as subtle particles, devotees join palms in reverence.

Upon hundreds of thousands of golden pillars, beautifully encircled by rounded beams of indranila gems, separately extended precious bamboo rafters, evenly painted with ruby upper covers. From the sides of luminous jeweled lattices, melodious sounds invite guests from all directions. High precious crown jewels, beautiful emerald parasols with golden handles, white banners waving in all directions, and victory banners overwhelming others, marked with jeweled crests encircled by silk, radiant with the white luster of pearl lattices, beautifully illuminated by the light of perfect dawn, jeweled fans from all apertures, adorned with strings of pundarika flowers, golden balconies with silver railings - this is the supreme resting place of existence.

At the pillared entrances, great lions prance and run with open mouths. The door guardians making proclamations protect like fearsome proud ones. Various flowers like atimukta and others, extremely beautiful blossoms, fragrant earth and stones, rows of sala and sandalwood trees. Here and there, melodies of shaṅkha birds, encircled by beautiful silver fences. Divine youths with bound topknots, delighting in dharma, offering incense from caskets, bowing respectfully with covered heads. From eighty-four thousand songs, these verses of exhortation arise:

"The time has come for what was prophesied by Dipankara in the past. Lord who has vanquished the hosts of afflictions, consider completing the benefit of beings. Though there is joy in Tushita's measureless palace, and the gods are faithful, and many are insatiable for hearing, it would be joyous if you descend to earth. Supreme enlightenment is not far; fortunate humans are there. Brahma, Prajapati and other form realm gods come to that place. Many asuras, nagas, yakshas, gandharvas, pretas, rakshasas and others appear proclaimed to you. It is said there is none here who attains enlightenment in divine form."

Through these verses of exhortation and by the power of previous aspirations, the unceasing hearing caused the noble Svetaketu to emerge from that great measureless palace of Tushita to the palace called "Elevated by Dharma." There, at the teaching seat for gods called "Excellent Dharma Lion Throne," he became naturally magnificent. Those devaputras who were of equal fortune with Bodhisattva Svetaketu and entered the same vehicle, with minds concordant with the bodhisattva, in that very palace with utterly pure minds...
In the ten directions, gathered celestial bodhisattvas with divine bodies in harmony with Śvētaketu took aspirational vows over many eons. Each was accompanied by their respective retinues of sixty-eight million, seated on their individual lion thrones. At that time, the divine and human realms resounded with great drums like this: When the azure maiden's beautiful face gathers the furrowed brows of twilight clouds, the radiant and lovely youthful sun enters the western ocean for ablution. Like maidens of other continents with bright smiling faces, side-glancing eyes watching the sun's face, the thousand-rayed victor of directions calls from the peak of the eastern mountain of desire. At twelve years of age, Śvētaketu, like a triple-mountain blooming utpala moon, leaving the peak of Mount Tuṣita in the west, swiftly climbs to the terrace of the eastern mountain of Jambudvīpa. The all-pervading golden drum proclaims: "The white light of enlightened activity is placed upon Śiva's dreadlocks." Oh what joy, as it plays and floats in the center of the lotus-ears of the pure realm's lord with his crown of dreadlocks. Then the wise divine sons of the pure realm, descended to earth, transformed into brahmin form, teaching Vedic texts and instructing others in reading. Then from the Vedic texts, learned brahmins heard thus: "Some descended from the divine realm, white as ashes, with beautiful double-tusks and six tusks, face beautifully covered with four golden nets, with red rounded crown, having entered a mother's womb, that person will surely possess the thirty-two marks of a great being. This becomes two ways: never a third. If remaining at home, a universal monarch with seven precious possessions. If going forth, will become fully enlightened." Thus capable of prophecy, brahmin teachers appeared. Some divine youths, having arrived in Jambudvīpa, urged the pratyekabuddhas: "Now when twelve years are complete, the Bodhisattva will enter the womb. You should depart this realm." Then five hundred sages of Varanasi, in the fearless deer forest, hearing this sound, like cakra birds rose seven palm trees high, finally entering the fire element. Now known as the Fallen Sages, abandoning aging and sickness, they passed into nirvana. Only relics fell in that place. Moreover, the Bodhisattva from his lofty dharma palace observed the time and place for transferring, contemplating continent and caste. The time is when the sun of birth, aging, sickness and death illuminates Jambudvīpa, not when darkness of permanence makes it night. The continent is solely Jambudvīpa, where lies the essence of enlightenment, vajra seat and excellent bodhi tree. The region is not the borderlands where people are foolish and dumb like sheep, acting carelessly, but only the central region. The caste is either royal or brahmin noble caste - though born in both, at this time only the royal caste honored by all. Thus the Bodhisattva's countless noble retinue each contemplated corresponding regions and castes. Then the divine assembly examined the royal castes of sixteen great regions of Jambudvīpa, but seeing all had faults, asked the Bodhisattva himself. Then to his assembly he explained sixty-four qualities of caste and mother...
The thirty-two qualities are there wherever one enters. On the fifteenth day of the ascending month, it was clearly proclaimed that he would enter the womb of a mother who had taken the ritual purification. Then, the assembly thought about Śuddhodana of the Śākya clan, who possessed these noble qualities. The qualities of the mother, the divine lady Māyā, were like those created by a magician - pleasant to touch like cotton, free from wrongdoing and devoted, beautiful from every angle, free from pride, her speech free from idle chatter and attachment, her food like nectar, her face like the full moon, destined to be the mother of a Tathāgata, not an ordinary woman, now dwelling in the Śākya palace in youthful form, the essence of perfection, stealing the beauty from others, radiant like a white banner. The assembly of deities proclaimed that she was worthy to be the mother of the Bodhisattva.

Having thus examined the lineage, from the celestial palace of Tuṣita, seated on the great throne called "High Victory Banner," he spoke thus to the assembly: "Let all gather here. Listen to me teach the final dharma, equal to the Tathāgatas. Now, while I have independence, having crossed to the perfection beyond the ocean of birth, aging and death, and having conquered Māra, with compassion for all beings like cattle, I shall liberate all from the ocean of existence."

Hearing these words, all gathered. Then the Bodhisattva blessed the courtyard to the measure of the four continents. Seeing the beautiful and pleasing ornamental arrangements, the gods dwelling in the desire and form realms, when thinking of the pleasures of their own homes, developed the perception of them as charnel grounds. In that well-arranged great courtyard, encircled by a round silver fence, within it golden square platforms, at the base rising ten leagues high, about a hundred thousand jeweled ponds, ruby wish-fulfilling trees touching the sky with their peaks, beautiful canopies of blue lotus leaves forming cooling pavilions, trees dropping fans in all directions, surrounded by millions in all directions and quarters, golden threads connecting the latticed windows, pearl nets hanging from makara mouths adorned with jewel patterns, silver mirrors set in the lattice openings. From the pleasant sounds of wind-moved bells came the words: "The conditioned is impermanent, there is no chance for permanence. The contaminated is not happiness, it's delusion to grasp it as such. All phenomena are selfless and free from extremes. Nirvana is complete peace, free from the extreme of peace" - these melodious sounds were heard.

At the highest treetops, blazing jewel lights illuminated a hundred directions down to below. Many precious fruits constantly swaying and ripening, between the rays of blazing jewels were crystal pools of swirling nectar. By the shores of these lakes, on silver lotus petals, golden bees hovered and played. Divine youth manifestations threw rings in play and delight. Forest cuckoos called sweetly, beautiful peacocks sang songs, cranes raised their wings and throats, charming geese with their honking expressed teachings of disenchantment.

On the smooth and even surface of the golden platform, anointed with fragrant water of indranīla gems, the courtyard floor was clear and blue, scattered with thousand-petaled golden lotuses. Attractive red lotuses with long stems were arranged in straight checkered patterns, at all intersections jewel garlands were added, and powder of the seven precious substances was spread. In the center was a throne supported by eight great lions...
The Brilliant Jeweled Necklace of Light,
A fine white cotton throne cover,
And a backdrop of shimmering jewels,
The golden flowers,
With fresh luminous colors,
Pleasing to behold from every angle,
Worshipped by all who possess pride.
The agaru incense,
Dispelling endless suffering,
Respectfully offered according to ritual,
Five deities established on the ground.
The Indra's jewel,
Not only that, but even Brahma,
Having gained understanding, offered it,
There is wondrous illumination.
The essence of the lotus-filled waters,
With its excellent sweet fragrance,
And saffron-scented water,
Like young saffron-colored twilight clouds.
Sugar and honey foods,
And medicine free from wrongdoing,
Along with sweet-scented camphor,
Offered without clinging to them as mine.
The melodious song of the kalavinka bird,
Like the sweet sound of a yodel from the mouth,
Gently flowing like the Ganges,
From within my egg,
Again manifesting and being born, thus say
The mother kalavinka birds.
The qualities of the lotus,
Some through the power of aspiration,
The god of desire with his curved bow,
And even proud Brahma,
Worship silently without clamor.
Even the golden crown pieces
Are spread as seats for White Crown.
Upon the magnificent lion throne
Endowed with such qualities,
The Bodhisattva White Crown
Seated peacefully and majestically,
Speaks thus to the divine assembly:
"Friends, look at this bodhisattva body,
Well adorned with excellent marks
Of a hundred merits.
Look well at all these
Final-existence bodhisattvas
Coming from all ten directions,
Who will transfer to Jambudvipa."
Then the great assembly,
Seeing that gathering of bodhisattvas,
Made prostrations with five limbs
And expressed their praise.
Then he spoke these words:
"When the time comes
For bodhisattvas to pass away,
Listen respectfully to the teaching
Of the hundred and eight doors of Dharma:
Faith, supreme joy, delight,
The three restraints of body, speech, and mind,
Six recollections, four immeasurables,
Four of impermanence, suffering, and selflessness,
Conscience, shame, truth,
Three right dharma practices, taking refuge,
Understanding crafts and skills,
Knowledge of dharma, time, and conquering pride,
Non-hatred and holding no grudges,
Devotion, non-attachment, non-malice,
Non-delusion and seeking dharma's meaning,
Desiring dharma, seeking dharma, right application,
Understanding name and form, overcoming causal views,
Skilled in abandoning attachment and anger, skilled in aggregates,
Skilled in elements and sense fields,
Attaining patience for non-arising phenomena,
Thirty-seven factors of enlightenment,
Generating bodhicitta, intention, application, and higher aspiration,
Six perfections and skillful means,
Four means of gathering and ripening beings,
Upholding sacred dharma, two accumulations,
Shamatha, vipassana, four reliances,
Dharani, confidence, learning,
Concordant dharma patience,
Patience of non-arising phenomena,
The stage of non-regression,
The wisdom-holder and empowerment stages.
These are the doors of dharma appearance;
Friends, these hundred and eight doors of dharma
Are definitely taught to the assembly
When bodhisattvas pass away."
When he spoke thus,
Eighty-four thousand divine sons generated bodhicitta.
Thirty-two thousand with previous training
Attained patience for non-arising phenomena.
Thirty-six million divine sons
Attained the pure, stainless, and immaculate
Dharma eye for all phenomena.
Then Bodhisattva White Crown
Spoke these verses:
"O friends, happiness
Is virtue free from wrongdoing.
Whatever amount of previous karma done,
I know without doubt.
If again, abandoning clamor,
One does not accumulate virtuous parts,
The power of...
Once, like the head of a palm tree being cut at the waning moon, one finally goes to the realm of unfortunate beings. Yet if one continues to practice virtue, one quickly becomes free from sickness, aging and death. Abiding in the paramitas, engage others in crossing over. Like a white victory banner, for the benefit of all mother beings, I send forth emanations and others. Enduring the sufferings of heat and cold, quickly attaining the state of victory, becoming Vajreshvara himself, for the benefit of beings like the lame and others, defeating the host of evil-doing maras, we will quickly turn the wheel of Dharma. From the highest pure land of Akanishtha down to the realm of Rahu, except for those without fortune, those with bright complexions will come to hear the Dharma. You too should come to that place on earth! Ha! That most delightful nectar I will give to you with great joy. I will accomplish that great purpose!

Having heard those words, all the assembly of deities, their minds burning with sorrow, their faces dark like closed kumuda flowers, bearing heavy burdens and straining, afflicted by suffering to the point of death, wailed and spoke these words: "Blessed One, if you do not remain here, who will explain our share of Dharma? To which holy lord shall we make requests? Who will tame our afflictions?"

The White Crown spoke: "This crown and my diadem I now bestow upon Maitreya. If you accept, you will be prosperous. This Arya Maitreya Natha, before long, will fully awaken on earth in Jambudvipa following Shakyamuni. The silver railing enclosure and the jeweled canopy above - our Dharma throne covered with silk beneath - respect him like a crown and make requests to the Lord. Listen to whatever Vajra words he speaks. Calling 'Victory! Victory!' offer cool fans of chamaras, tsa tram ka and pa tam ke. He will be the one father of you all, mother beings. This bright beautiful Tushita is pure like Venus. Quickly freed from sickness, aging and death, from now on be respectful. In the end, he will not deceive. He is equal to the Tathagata. Quickly drink the nectar-like teachings from his full moon face. Listen respectfully and quietly to his complete teachings. Do not be arrogant or proud. Gradually you will become equal to me. Listen to whatever beneficial words he speaks. The deities endowed with love said "This Maitreya is our protector and refuge."

Having spoken thus, he empowered Invincible Maitreya as his own regent. Then gradually transferring to Jambudvipa, entering the womb and so forth, through the twelve excellent deeds he caused the beings of the billion-world system to enjoy excellent prosperity and benefit, spontaneously accomplishing unceasing enlightened activity. This concludes the first chapter showing the array of the bodhisattva dwelling in Tushita from the Noble Lalitavistara.

Here it is said: With supreme joy I bow to Victorious Maitreya in Tushita, the holy unconquered one who removes negative karma and habitual tendencies. "O Victorious Unconquered One! From the Land of Snows I ask: Where has the son of Shuddhodana gone? I have not heard where he dwells. Though searching with much clamor, not even a fraction was found. Alas! Unconquered One! All people on earth have heard you dwell very near. O Sanskrit scholars like Sharada and others, I take refuge in you - please grant me a moment! Sitting aside from the son of Shuddhodana, I wish to make some poetic requests. Alas, Son of Shuddhodana! You who have one birth remaining in the god realm - will you lead all to this Jambudvipa? Won't the god realm be empty? Even so, in the human realm...
Many pure ones keep the moral law. Was this offered as a loan to those in the divine realms? You sent all beings on earth to the divine realms. In that joyful dharma assembly, did such renunciation bear fruit? Without listening to anyone's delays, you transferred to Jambudvipa. Why did you send humans to be with Maitreya in Tushita? Did you engage in activities, and then engage in their activities too? If so, then send us also to Tushita realm. Your complete holy dharma remains there, passed down to others. We worldly beings who have merit and sharp minds - you liberated all of us to the divine realms and peaceful expanse. Then you left a few beings of dull minds and weak merit who died in lower realms here in Jambudvipa. By your departure to another realm, haven't you impoverished the former inhabitants of Jambudvipa? Now show us protectorless ones what to do. Merciless enemy of Mara, you heartlessly burned all the forest of samsara of gods and humans with the fire of wisdom. In that wilderness of peaceful nirvana, you mighty one with concentration dwell alone like an elephant. Weren't you somewhat lonely? Yet the gods of existence, with compassion mixed with delusion and attachment, with the twelve links, from thunder clouds of unceasing wheels sound drums and spread rain of afflictions and karma. On the good earth of birth, they made the forest of samsara flourish. The forest of samsara is joyless, filled with flocks of divine and human cuckoos coming swiftly from elsewhere. From there you heard solace. In former times your nectar-like words were left as teachings for humans of Jambudvipa. The elders of the world say that at that time humans were free from decline. These days your nectar-like words have become subtle like butter, and though examined again and again with the eye of wisdom, they become less clear day by day. O Sun-like Buddha endowed with great compassion, if you were born in that deathless realm, why do you not always remain at the peak of Jambudvipa's merit mountain in the east? If you think you departed swiftly drawn by the chariot of disciples' merit in other realms, why didn't you transfer there from the beginning together with your equally fortunate bodhisattvas? If you came as lord to this realm because other realms are not places for attaining buddhahood, after becoming enlightened here, if you had remained constantly working for beings in other realms, wouldn't refusing to do so count you among the wicked of the world? When the time came to accomplish benefit in other realms, how does it not contradict your promise that you could instantly emanate countless forms while remaining unmoved in meditation? If the time for disciples in Jambudvipa has passed, why does the sun of thousand-rayed enlightened activities still repeatedly shine forth from the shoulder of the eastern mountain of doctrine holders? If you had not accomplished benefit for beings in other realms and were circling like the sun, why did the Buddha-sun not appear for 3,600 years after setting? Did you not previously generate supreme intention especially considering the people of Jambudvipa? Why did you swiftly depart, leaving most of us Jambudvipa humans as you pleased? However, these are not your faults, but the exhaustion of our own bad fortune. Though the night captain does not move from his place, this rises in the midst of the clear ocean, but not in a pond of terrible turbidity. Yet if you sincerely considered the people of Jambudvipa before, why didn't you transfer to Tushita realm without coming to Jambudvipa?
Like Maitreya, O White Crown, 
Why do you not dwell here until now?
These days, some people
Have gone before Maitreya.
If practiced properly, just as
Maitreya has come to this place,
If you too dwell in Tuṣita,
By the steps of the stream of Dharma,
That realm is not far to traverse.
There you will drink the complete nectar.
Or at the time of death,
If you contemplate your form,
Will you not take miraculous birth
Upon your lotus throne?
These days, Lord of Sages,
If you do not reveal
The source of where you dwell,
How can we make aspirations?
Therefore, equal to your wisdom
And your compassion,
You are the unconquered Maitreya,
And if you, without jealousy,
Grant your compassionate permission,
I sincerely take refuge in him.
His dwelling place
Is not very far from here.
One who is not your equal,
How could they occupy your throne?
Therefore, to the Victor Maitreya,
I sincerely and respectfully bow.
With love for all beings,
Generation of supreme bodhicitta,
And holding the holy Dharma,
I make excellent offerings to you.
Through much learning, wisdom,
And generating supreme bodhicitta,
"One will be born in Maitreya's realm,"
Thus spoke the Compassionate One.
Therefore, each and every day,
In the sky before the venerable lord,
Through devotion, mantra,
And mudra, clearly inviting you,
I generate bodhicitta
Through the ritual taught in the chapter on discipline.
Then to the general teachings of the Victor,
Particularly Maitreya's teachings,
I shall seek and always protect
Pure and stainless learning.
Whatever discipline is received,
For as long as it is maintained,
Keep it unstained by faults,
Guard it always like your life.
Then at the time of death,
By merely remembering the venerable lord,
In that instant, may rays of compassion
Rest upon my crown.
Seeing the venerable one's face mandala
Pure and clear,
With joy, delight,
Limitless faith and wonder,
In the thousand-petaled lotus center,
May I complete a pure and clear body,
Hear the supreme vehicle's dharma,
And attain patience in the unborn dharma.
Then through the limitless
Displays of the bodhisattva,
Without need for effort, in the pure lands,
May I accomplish many benefits for beings.
When this life's sun of a thousand distracting rays
Is veiled by the black cloth of sudden aging,
When lying in death's western bed,
When directly facing it, may Lord Maitreya's compassion
Illuminate all directions with white light.
Rising mindfully from bed, with discipline
Like soft undergarments and learning as upper robes,
Well-fastened with the belt of conscientiousness,
Having respectfully bowed to the venerable lord's feet,
Offering the pure incense of discipline,
With the nectar food of dhāraṇī and samādhi,
May I beat the great drum of pure aspiration.
May this life's sun, captain of swans,
When falling into death's western lotus lake,
By the great wind force of the venerable one's compassion,
Fly to the sky of Tuṣita.
When this life's sun sets in Jambudvīpa,
At the three times, may I climb
The eastern mountain ledge of Tuṣita
And clearly see the venerable one's smiling face.
With clear discriminating wisdom like the dawn sky,
Pure discipline like intervals between sessions as robes,
With side-long glances of flourishing youth and learning,
Taking the nectar of the venerable one's sun-moon face.
The lineage of supreme spiritual friends unbroken,
Learning's eastern fan extensively arranged,
On the peak of wisdom's mighty mountain,
How could the sun of the venerable one's compassion not rise?
In the Kumuda garden, supreme abode of joyful faith,
In that lake where rays of compassion's coolness fall,
Why would the venerable guide of swans not arrive?
For some holy masters of deathless accomplishment,
Their wisdom-lotus blooms with faith,
At that ocean shore where learning's waters move,
Why would the venerable one's face not appear?

Thus, regarding the Compassionate One, the Lord of Sages, descending from Tuṣita realm,
This "Swan's Song of Generating Bodhicitta in Tuṣita" composed as if in praise,
Was respectfully composed by the poet Mipham Gewai Shenyen of Central Tibet,
In the temple of Nyug Gyal Khang in Upper Tsang,
During the first part of the month of Snron in the Iron-Female-Hare year,
With pure devotion to Maitreya. Mangalam!

The Array of Sukhāvatī and Pure Aspirations
In Accordance with the Sūtras: The White Lotus Garland

Amitābha bhūta prabha viśuddha sūta unu mālā nāma

The Array of Sukhāvatī and Pure Aspirations in Accordance with the Sūtras: The White Lotus Garland

I respectfully bow to the stainless lotus feet of the Omniscient One, supreme among speakers.
Lord of Speech, Blessed Mañjuśrī himself,
Upon the vast cool-rayed throne,
Voice of eloquence delighting the wise,
Like a thousand gandharva maidens' string music,
Teaching all with sweet instruction,
Smiling and graceful like an enchanting goddess,
Gathering all purposes through beautiful poetry,
I bow to you who controls all without exception.
Those who know how to compose beautiful poetry
Are honored by all in the three worlds.
Fresh bundles of poetic utpalas
Are respectfully taken into the hair of impartial beings.
Therefore, with poetic grace like
The sweet voice of the compassionate Teacher,
I respectfully express - may those with good wisdom-eyes
Listen attentively with faithful minds.

In times past, at the junction of fresh saffron-colored clouds,
With the luster of young monks' robes,
Stealing the beauty of the azure sky,
Led by a flock of renunciants like swans,
The wise monk named Chökyi Jungné,
With undiminished prayer-voice like a drum,
Adorned with a garland of golden drops of courage,
With vast white wings of the two accumulations,
Embraced by a garland of lotus-like qualities,
Wishing to hold the milk-ocean of excellent realms,
To the Teacher, the Lord of the World,
I bow to one who roars songs of praise.

For billions of years of that Teacher,
Billions and trillions of Buddhas,
The qualities of eighty-one billion buddha-fields
Were well described and combined into one.
When advised to hold that supreme realm,
The unequaled Sukhāvatī, renowned
As never before emanated by any Buddha,
I bow to you who generated such supreme intention.

Until the great poison-ocean of
The three lower realms and demigods
Is not dried up in that realm
Where one attains enlightenment through emanated forms,
And until humans and nectar-eaters in the milk-ocean,
Adorned with the luster of golden robes,
And those with incomplete clairvoyance,
I will not attain enlightenment as King of Swans -
I bow to one who proclaimed such great vows.

Until the delightful flock of swan-like disciples
Flying in that supreme realm's nectar-ocean
Have not definitely become perfect,
And until the Teacher's lifespan,
The measure of the assembly of listeners,
The lifespan of all beings in that realm,
And the measure of that victor's light rays remain,
I bow to one who made such vows.
Until the neck drum of misdeeds is beaten,
Until living beings abandon the swan's play,
Until then, in that realm of the Swan King,
The wish-fulfilling ocean of pure conduct does not exist.
Until the ten directions' Buddhas do not hold
Your own manifest Buddha qualities
And the garlands of praise flowers extolling them,
I bow to you who made such promises.

Until those with beautiful faces in other realms
Wear as ear ornaments the golden utpala garland
Of excellent names of you, the fully enlightened victor,
And until at the time of death that Buddha
Is not clearly seen amid thick clouds of ocean-like retinues,
I bow to you who made such promises.

Until all beings born in that realm
Are not adorned with precious pearl garlands
Of the thirty-two major marks,
And until all who hear the drum sound proclamation
Of that excellent nectar-lake realm
Do not naturally take birth there
With minds wishing to go on uplifted wings,
I bow to you who made such promises.

Until all beings, except those definitely engaged
In Samantabhadra's conduct
In that supreme realm of perfect enlightenment,
Have not attained unsurpassed enlightenment in one life,
And until they have not obtained the four individual realizations,
They will not manifest complete enlightenment -
I bow to you who made such promises.

Until whatever offering materials
The Buddhas' children of that realm make to other Buddhas
Do not fall like rain as soon as thought of,
And until those who generate the mind to make offerings daily
Are not lovingly accepted by the Buddhas of the ten directions
Taking hold of those offering substances,
I bow to you who made such promises.

Until all beings born in that realm
Have not obtained the excellent vajra-like body,
Supreme divine ornaments,
The dharma teachings of omniscience,
And the roots of virtue of seeking
The six-hundred-thousand-measure bodhi tree,
They will not attain enlightenment in that realm -
I bow to you who made such promises.

Until whatever beings in other realms
Generate faith merely hearing my name
Never take female form
From now until the essence of enlightenment,
Have complete faculties and practice purely,
And are worshipped by worldly beings including gods,
I bow to you who made such promises.

Until beings born in that realm
Have not obtained bliss surpassing
That of monks absorbed in the third dhyana,
They will not attain enlightenment, and until
The bodhisattvas have not obtained
The perfect array of Buddha realms,
And until dharma sounds do not arise as for shravakas,
I bow to you who made such promises.

Until bodhisattvas dwelling in other realms,
Upon hearing the name of the perfect Buddha,
Attain many doors of concentration through hearing,
Generate faith in enlightened conduct,
Take constant birth in excellent families,
Obtain patience of the unborn dharma,
And become irreversible from Buddha dharma,
I bow to you who made such promises.

Thus to the perfectly enlightened one
In the realm now proclaimed as Sukhavati,
Who like a mighty dharma-source swan king
Moving with confident, elegant stride,
Maintains the thread-lines of twenty thousand aspirations,
And while proclaiming dharma with resonant voice
Completes the festival of playing
In the vast ocean of the six perfections' nectar,
I bow in homage.

[Note: The final line fragment "khyod sku'i brjid pa byi ru'i l" appears to be incomplete and would continue in the next section]
Amassing in the aggregates,
Your radiant face outshines the brilliance of a hundred thousand suns.
Your elongated eyes vanquish the pride of red lotuses.
Glorious Victor, renowned as Amitabha,
Having become enlightened, you have enjoyed ten great eons,
And will remain countless more - to you I bow.

In other realms, you spend time performing bodhisattva deeds.
In that realm, as regent of Buddha Amitabha,
You firmly vowed to become fully enlightened - 
To you, mighty Avalokiteshvara of great compassion, I bow.

To some you appear as a bodhisattva holding many buddhas' treasures,
To others as a universal monarch ruling all classes,
And elsewhere as the subduer of malevolent ones.
To you who possess the power of the space-like body, I bow.

The light of that teacher, the Victor,
His lifespan, and assembly of hearers
Increase as if competing with each other,
"They are measureless," say the elders here.

The azure goddess with various loose ornaments,
With the face of a passionate, radiant maiden,
Says those in their prime can meet
The beloved face with captivating red-hued body.

When your light rays, with the glow of red lotus,
Pervade the infinite limits of the knowable,
How could the sapphire-colored azure goddess's
Sidelong glance not traverse that sphere?

When none can find another example
Equal to the measure of your lifespan,
What of the young, graceful maiden
In blue silk garments with eyes like the sun and moon?

The lifespan of that azure goddess - 
Is not your lifespan the same as hers?
The measure of your assembled hearers
Can never be counted by numbers.

How could it be less than the number of knowables?
If that number could compete with knowables,
Why would the omniscient one not see that number?
If seen, how wondrous that number would be non-existent!

The skilled poets of logic
Dwell in the bow-shaped tent of doubt.
Yet if they generate faith despite their doubts,
Though born in that realm, in the lotus womb itself,
They become intoxicated by the wine of cessation for five hundred years.
Therefore, I bow without doubt.

If one bows there having dispelled doubt,
On the great lion throne of lotuses in that realm,
Born pure and clear from the very start,
One experiences the feast of dharma.

Therefore, through that Victor's aspirations
And beings' wonderful merit,
The realm accomplished by compassion, obtaining a share,
To the immaculate Sukhavati, I bow.

Like the wondrous beauty of a peacock's parasol, if even the proud Brahma cannot emanate all varied forms, what need to mention the Lord of the Desire Realm's emanations? Immaculate Sukhavati steals away the pride of hundreds of thousands of joys and pleasures.

The ground - melted by drinking the light rays of a hundred thousand suns of pleasing aspirations and compassion - is smooth like a mirror's surface, its luster outshining the radiance of the azure goddess's clear garments.

Adorned with various jeweled ornaments, decorated with designs drawn on crystal threads strung with golden lines gleaming with hundred great colors, when pressed it gives four fingers, when lifted it springs up equally.

Vast, with borders rivaling space's expanse, surrounded by walls of stacked golden bricks crowned with majestic high crystal pavilions, at its borders flow a thousand delightful rivers with hundred-stepped ghats.

Surrounded by rows of sapphire water trees and palm trees touching the sky, their canopy of leaves spreading for hundred yojanas, connected at intervals by golden chains...
In a place adorned with dangling pearls, prosperous with good harvests, where gods and humans rejoice,

Where trees made of the seven precious substances - gold, silver, beryl, crystal, pearls, rubies, and precious stones - are filled with Buddha-emanated birds singing sweet songs. In all directions, fragrant breezes waft divine incense that delights the senses. When precious flowers and fruits fall to the ground, they spread powders of gold, silver, and pearls, filling spaces up to seven palm trees high. From time to time, emanated clouds resound with divine music and thunder, raining perfumed water and powders of the seven precious substances and sandalwood, while parasols and victory banners wave, adorned with excellent kācalindika cloth.

Beautiful goddesses wave jeweled fans with crystal parasols on golden handles and silver bells, dancing with outstretched arms, scattering precious flowers while sandalwood fragrance naturally rises. Magnificent lotus thrones with countless precious petals raised like peacock necks with handles stretch from one to ten leagues without gaps, radiating thirty-six billion light rays. From each ray-tip appear thirty-six thousand golden-hued Buddhas with excellent marks, each with vast retinues, traveling in the ten directions teaching dharma to all beings.

Marvelous divine bliss and whatever splendor one desires is bestowed by hundred thousand precious rivers twelve leagues deep, flowing with melodious sounds, while golden bells in wish-fulfilling trees ring sweetly. The profound and clear dharma drum sounds with sixty aspects harmonize with thousands of gandharva lute melodies, delighting the ears. Lakes of swirling perfumed water infused with tamāla, costus, sandalwood, and snake-essence fragrances are covered with networks of white lotuses. Swans, cranes, parrots, cuckoos, kalavinka birds, and peacocks with sweet voices dispel mental weariness.

Moreover, whatever I desire manifests through mere thought - how could the Paranirmitavaśavartin gods compete with this pure land of bliss? That Teacher's bodhi tree is six hundred thousand leagues tall, its branches spanning eight hundred leagues, with roots five hundred leagues deep. Always bearing leaves, flowers and fruits that captivate all minds, it sparkles with divine and human jewel garlands that constantly sway and blaze with gems. Ornamental chains of pearls both blue and red are strung on golden thread, decorated with auspicious endless knots, while precious nets and half-nets hang from lions' and makaras' mouths, their sweet ringing sounds summoning and magnetizing guests from all directions.

The six qualities of that tree: when experienced by the six senses, they generate six undefiled blisses and six supernormal powers of non-regression. Thus, immediately upon hearing this and recalling such qualities, beyond hundreds of thousands of billions of Buddha-fields to the west, the Tathagata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened Buddha Amitābha dwells, surrounded by an immeasurable assembly of great bodhisattvas and countless śrāvakas.
Just as Ārya Ānanda bowed and scattered flowers at the feet of the one dwelling in the perfectly adorned pure land, likewise I too bow, make offerings, and generate joy, delight, faith, devotion, and rejoicing. Just as all the Buddhas dwelling in the infinite world systems of the ten directions genuinely hold and praise the name of the Bhagavān, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly complete Buddha Amitābha, likewise I too shall genuinely hold the name of that Bhagavān. I shall generate joy, delight, faith, devotion, and rejoicing in that Bhagavān.

Just as the countless great bodhisattva mahāsattvas dwelling in the infinite world systems of the ten directions make aspirations to be born in that Sukhāvatī world realm in order to see, prostrate to, serve, and thoroughly question the Dharma teachings of Bhagavān Amitābha, likewise I too shall make aspirations to be born in that world realm. I shall generate joy and so forth toward that world realm.

Just as the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya held, maintained, read, and fully comprehended the Dharma discourse on the array of qualities of Bhagavān Amitābha's pure land, extensively and genuinely taught it to others, and generated the perception of it as the teacher, likewise I too shall do the same - holding and so forth this Dharma discourse. I shall generate joy and so forth in this Dharma discourse.

Just as the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya had no doubt about the perfect array of qualities of Sukhāvatī pure land, likewise I too shall be without doubt and shall generate joy, delight, faith and so forth. Just as those who make aspirations while doubting the array of qualities of that pure land remain in a lotus womb for five hundred years without obtaining certainty through seeing Buddhas and bodhisattvas, hearing the sublime Dharma, and discussions expanding many doors of Dharma, I shall strive so that does not happen. I shall clear away doubt, cross over uncertainty, and not be of two minds.

Just as when Ārya Ānanda expressed in words his wish to see Sukhāvatī pure land, light radiated from the palm of Bhagavān Amitābha's hand allowing all those in this Sahā world system to directly see Sukhāvatī pure land, likewise I too sincerely wish to see the array of qualities of that Sukhāvatī world realm. I shall generate joy and so forth in seeing it.

Thus, through the power of combining all these sublime roots of virtue - the joy, delight, faith, clarity, devotion, rejoicing, abandoning doubt, and generating the mind toward that pure land regarding that Bhagavān and the array of qualities of his pure land, as well as other roots of virtue of non-attachment, non-hatred, and non-delusion, and especially relying on the power of Bhagavān Amitābha's own special previous aspirations - when the time of my death approaches, may I directly see victorious Amitābha, brilliant and radiant amidst his ocean-like retinue in the space before me. Through unshakeable faith focused on him...
May we realize the supreme wisdom that discriminates all phenomena, loving-kindness focused on beings, compassion, and the awakening mind. Through the great compassion of the Victorious One Amitābha and his retinue, may we be taken under their care and directly perceive the path to Sukhāvatī, and through their miraculous powers, may we enter Sukhāvatī without obstruction. At that very moment, may we be miraculously born seated in cross-legged posture in the center of a hundred thousand-petaled lotus, possessing the thirty-two marks of a great being, with perfect body, sharp faculties, undiminished senses, and endowed with the faculty of omniscience. With unwavering and immovable faculties, may we immediately behold the face of the Victorious One and his heirs, obtain certainty in hearing the holy Dharma and engaging in meaningful discourse. May we attain the five superknowledges and acceptance of the unborn nature of phenomena. Having only one birth remaining, may we swiftly attain complete and perfect enlightenment. Each morning, as desired, may offering substances manifest from our hands: beautiful flowers, fragrant incense, bright lamps, lovely garlands, ointments, powders that delight the senses, soft and smooth fabrics, parasols, victory banners, high-raised standards, cymbals, melodious songs pleasing to the mind, and thick, magnificent musical sounds. May these arise the moment we generate bodhicitta, and may we make supreme offerings to all the Blessed Buddha-bhagavāns of other world realms. May these offering substances appear in the space above each respective object of offering as pavilions of flowers and other materials in the shape of parasols, measuring hundreds of thousands of leagues, remaining suspended in the air for a long time. Having thus generated roots of virtue by serving countless Buddhas of other world realms, may we return that same morning to Sukhāvatī and be able to please Victorious Amitābha and his heirs with such offerings. Then, when Victorious Amitābha smiles, may thirty-six trillion light rays emerge from his mouth and pervade many world realms. Furthermore, upon birth in that realm, may all conceptual thoughts of self and phenomena naturally pacify, and may we attain wisdom exalted by direct knowledge, equal to Mount Meru, not depending on others in performing vast bodhisattva conduct. May we attain wisdom like an unperturbed ocean of intelligence, wisdom pure and brilliant like refined gold, and wisdom like the sun and moon as the source of thousands of light rays. May we attain qualities like the earth supporting all qualities, wisdom like flowing water cleansing the stains of afflictions, and wisdom like fire burning all conceptual thoughts. May we attain wisdom like thunder proclaiming what is Dharma and non-Dharma, wisdom like an ocean releasing streams of Dharma, and wisdom like a great bull skilled in overwhelming great assemblies. May we attain wisdom like a well-trained elephant, wisdom like a swift horse, and wisdom like the king of deer, free from fear.
May I obtain compassion like the king of Nyagrodha trees that completely protects all; compassion like Mount Meru unmoved by adverse winds; and compassion like space pervading limitless realms. May I obtain compassion like great Brahma that precedes all virtuous dharmas; compassion like the Garuda king that destroys the serpents of hatred; and compassion rare as the Udumbara flower. Furthermore, may I become like a great elephant king: always disciplined and composed, with sharp faculties, patient and gentle, without jealousy of others' excellence, skilled in ascertaining dharma, fearless in dharma discussions, and insatiable in pursuit of learning. May I become like the king of vaidurya with pure moral discipline, and like a jewel mine with inexhaustible learning. Furthermore, may I be impartial to all beings without bias, skilled in properly distributing both dharma and material things, steadfast, brave, conscientious, pleasant company, illuminating the world, possessed of clear supernatural knowledge, endowed with the power of aspirations, removed of the thorn of pride, praised by the victorious ones, accomplishing purified wisdom, courageous, enduring, of vast assembly, supreme among the herd, truthful, mindful, intelligent, realized, possessing wisdom's weapon, meritorious, always diligent in dharma, and possessing ocean-like learning of all dharmas. Having become thus, may I obtain the state of a universal monarch unequaled in beating the great dharma drum, blowing the great dharma conch, raising the great dharma victory banner, waving the great dharma flag, and lighting the great dharma lamp.

In brief, through properly hearing and contemplating the sutra on the qualities of Sukhavati, may it be so through: the power of firm confident faith in Bhagavan Amitabha; the power of aspiration dedicating all roots of virtue as causes for birth in that pure realm; the power of wisdom non-conceptualizing the three spheres; the power of generating the mind of unsurpassed enlightenment; the power of the pure compassion of the incomparable King of the Shakyas; the compassion of Bhagavan Amitabha; the power of previous vast aspirations' blessings and might; and the power of the inconceivable, completely pure dharmadhatu.

When this aspiration is fulfilled, may there be auspiciousness of Sukhavati, the manifestation of the Victorious Ones and their heirs in emanated forms possessing the three qualities of wisdom, love and power of Protector Amitayus. May there be auspiciousness of all Victorious Ones and their heirs: Amitabha who possesses the treasury of all wisdom, Avalokiteshvara the lord of infinite compassion, and Vajrapani who obtained great power defeating all maras' forces. One who is insatiable in hearing Buddha's words, skilled in expanding garlands of poetic experience, following the Sage with discipline and analysis - may such a one be thus in that wondrous realm. Are the Tushitas happy or Sukhavati residents blissful? Is Maitreya loving or Rejoicing One causing joy? Though Tushita is happy, Sukhavati residents are blissful. Though Maitreya is loving, Rejoicing One causes joy. Going for bliss, bliss for going; if joyful aspiring, if aspiring joyful; if born joyful, if joyful born; if seeing blissful, if blissful seeing; if meeting faithful, if faithful meeting; if inspired teaching, if teaching inspired.
When explained, it brings joy; where there is faith, there is conviction;
Delighting brings pleasure, pleasure brings delight.
Appearing yet empty, empty yet appearing,
Dependent yet arising, arising yet dependent.
Therefore, in that realm, joy
And bliss, faith and such,
The union of appearance and emptiness—
Whoever possesses such wisdom,
That person, free from doubt,
Is not far from Sukhāvatī.

That praised one who generates delight,
The Blessed One Amitābha by name,
His crimson color is crimson, the Victor's body,
His melodious voice is melodious, the Victor's speech,
His beneficial intent is beneficial, the Victor's mind,
To the Omniscient One, to that Omniscient One, I pay homage.

Complete enjoyment body, Lord of Light,
Having attained unequaled wisdom and life,
Supreme emanation bodies continuously appearing,
Through your fearlessness-granting nature,
You have made our fortune excellent.

With clear-complexioned face like Sarasvatī,
With joy and passion combined,
Like the radiant-wombed Mañjuśrī,
Teaching instructions and advice,
And furthermore endowed with deities,
Skilled in poetry,
From accumulating many views,
I declare this composition was made.

Thus "The White Lotus Garland," which describes the qualities of Sukhāvatī and pure aspirations in accordance with the sūtras, was composed by the poet Mañjuśrī Priyamitra of the central land at the Shangs Sukhāvatī temple on the first joyous day of the first half of the second month in the Iron-Female-Hare year.

[The text continues with verses about false pride, poetic composition, and concludes with verses about teaching, debating, and composing, followed by an auspicious dedication. The final line introduces a commentary on "Praise to the Dharmadhātu."]
A Commentary on "In Praise of Dharmadhatu" Called "Ascertaining the Dharmadhatu"

I bow to the youthful wish-fulfilling tree of dharmadhatu forest, adorned with fresh garlands of qualities, radiant with the vitality of the three kayas' enlightened activities and their fruits.

Though constantly dwelling amidst blazing afflictions, the clear radiance of wisdom's coolness remains undiminished. With sharp edges that burn conceptual thoughts like firewood, here the wisdom of dharmadhatu shall be ascertained.

Having thus made offerings and stated the commitment to compose, there are two parts to the actual explanation: the reasons why this treatise needs to be explained word by word, and the specific explanation of the text's meaning.

First, the misconceptions that need to be cleared here are: thinking the term "dharmadhatu wisdom" does not appear in the vehicles of characteristics; explaining both the dharmadhatu of sentient beings and buddhas only in terms of non-affirming negation of emptiness; identifying the naturally abiding potential, dharmakaya, and non-abiding nirvana only from the perspective of non-affirming negation, unable to explain them from the perspective of luminous awareness; explaining the basic luminous awareness only as consciousness rather than wisdom; those who can explain these correctly still asserting that wisdom itself is the actual buddha and dharmakaya; consequently asserting all beings are buddhas; asserting this includes the actual major and minor marks, qualities like powers, and so forth; asserting there is an actual buddha essence at the basic level; not understanding the explanation of luminous awareness as beings' essence at the basic level and buddhas' essence at the resultant level, and instead asserting it is buddha essence at all stages; not understanding the explanation of applying different names according to the three stages - sentient being, bodhisattva, and buddha - and instead explaining it as buddha at all stages; being unable to explain the essence as wisdom when others explain it as the nature of mind with defilements, and instead explaining it only in terms of emptiness; thinking this text teaches inherently existent wisdom; claiming Nagarjuna and Asanga contradict each other regarding identification of naturally abiding potential and buddha essence; the misconception of not explaining the dharmadhatu being praised here as wisdom but only as emptiness.

Clearing away these misconceptions, generating certainty about the nature of dharmadhatu, how it exists in samsara and nirvana, how names are applied at these different stages, and so forth - this is the purpose of composing this commentary.

Second, regarding the meaning of the text, there are two parts: paying homage to dharmadhatu and extensively explaining that dharmadhatu.

First, I pay homage with body and speech and bow with mind. To what? Here, dharma refers to non-abiding nirvana. Its dhatu is its cause, the wisdom that pervades all stages of ground, path and result. What is its nature? That which, when not known and seen completely, leads to wandering in the three realms pulled by the chariot of afflictions, yet definitely abides in all sentient beings.

If this is identified as mere non-affirming negation, it could not lead to wandering in existence when unknown, nor could it definitely abide in beings.
That which does not exist, as it pervades even non-sentient beings. Second, there are two parts: identifying dharmadhātu and how it exists in the three states. First, that which becomes the cause of samsara - karma, afflictions, and conceptual thoughts - is the basis to be purified. When the dharmadhātu wisdom is purified of stains through the purifying path, that stainless wisdom itself has the synonyms of nirvana and dharmakāya. If these two synonyms apply to the basic dharmadhātu, there would be no purpose for the qualifying phrase "purified through purification." Second has three parts: how dharmadhātu naturally exists in pure state during the ground state of samsara; how the dharmakāya with two purities gradually increases during the state of noble Mahayana beings; and how the three kāyas and enlightened activities spontaneously arise at the state of buddhahood. The first has three parts: how dharmadhātu naturally exists as luminosity at the ground state; how it can purify stains due to this reason; and teaching that purifying stains depends on conditions that awaken the potential. The first has two parts: explaining examples proving that although wisdom exists there, it is not seen; and dispelling objections to its existence there. The first has four parts: using the example of milk and butter to show how this wisdom pervades all beings; using the example of vase and lamp to show this wisdom is always luminous; using the example of stone and stone essence to show the boundary of dispelling the darkness of not knowing despite being always luminous; and using the example of crystal to prove that luminosity exists even at the ground state. The first has two parts: the example of existing but not seeing oneself, and the example of seeing when purified of stains. First is "Just as when mixed with milk..." etc. Second is "Just as when milk is fully purified..." etc. The second has two parts: the example of luminosity not appearing to oneself, and the example of appearing when stains are removed. First is "Just as a lamp..." etc. Second has the actual point and dispelling objections. First is the two verses starting "From whatever directions..." Second: If one objects that the later luminous wisdom is newly produced through meditation on the path and did not exist at the ground state: The naturally luminous wisdom as subject cannot arise without a previous continuum of similar type, because it never ceases through interruption of a similar continuum and never arises as the nature of afflictions at any time. Therefore it is free from stains in its essence at the beginning, middle and end, rather than being newly produced, because it is dharmadhātu. Third has the example of natural luminosity and the boundary of dispelling the darkness of not knowing despite being that way. First is "Just as precious..." etc. Second is "Likewise..." etc. Fourth: If one thinks that although luminous nirvana exists at the time of nirvana, it did not exist at the ground state, this is shown through example that if it did not exist at the causal state it would not arise at the resultant state in the verse starting "When the element exists..." Second, dispelling objections has three parts: dispelling the objection that beings would be buddhas; dispelling the objection that beings would have buddha nature; and dispelling the objection that the antidotes that purify stains would destroy the element itself. First: If that wisdom exists unchanged in nature in all three states, it would follow that all beings are buddhas. The example proving this is not so is in the two verses starting "Just as when pressing..." Second has the actual point and proof that beings have the buddha element.
Though this is not the case, even if there were no difference in its presence during these three stages, if all beings had buddha-nature, just as a sugarcane plant, though lacking essence, produces sweet fruit due to having that potential, similarly, though beings lack buddha-nature, they give rise to the fruit of buddhahood due to having that potential. This is taught in two verses beginning with "The sugarcane has no essence." 

Second, though all beings lack buddha-essence, they possess that element of primordial wisdom. Without it, the result of buddhahood could not arise. This is explained in two verses beginning with "Thus from all seeds."

Here, one should not think that in the example the sweetness of the fruit is taught to be the essence of the sugarcane. It is taught to be its fruit, because if it were taught to be its essence, it would need to exist simultaneously and remain constant. Similarly, in terms of the meaning, buddhahood is taught to be the fruit of samsara, not taught to be its essence, because the text explicitly states samsara lacks essence.

If one objects that although it is well known that sugarcane lacks essence in the world, the example shows that the potential for sweet fruit is its essence, and similarly although samsara is known to lack essence, isn't the potential for the fruit of buddhahood explained as its essence? Though explained that way, at that point it explains beings have the buddha-element, but does not explain buddhahood itself is beings' essence. At that point, what understanding is there in saying beings possess buddha-essence?

In the fourth section, there is stating the doubt and answering it. First: If the primordial wisdom at the ground stage is not explained as buddha but explained as that from which buddha arises, does the element at the ground stage become buddha through being exhausted by antidotes like the defilements?

Second has three parts: teaching that obscurations must be removed, teaching that the obscured cannot be eliminated, and rejecting that wisdom would entail a self. 

The first has identifying obscurations and explaining examples of how they are removed. The first has example and meaning. First is "The stainless sun and moon..." Second is "Likewise the luminous mind..."

The second has example and meaning. First is "Just as fire purifies clothes..." Second is "Likewise the luminous mind..."

The second has logical reasoning and illustrative examples. First explains: The antidotes eliminate the defilements of the element but do not eliminate the element itself, in "The sutras teaching emptiness..." Second explains examples of why the element need not be abandoned in "The water present in the earth..."

This text teaches that the nature of dharmadhatu is wisdom, and since its essence is not to be abandoned, teaches it need not be eliminated.

Third: If one objects that if dharmadhatu pervades all stages of ground, path and result, it would accept a self that is liberated, take the primordial wisdom at the ground stage as the subject. It is not a self, etc. is what is to be proven. Because it is dharmadhatu is the reason. The pervasion is "Conceptually grasped objects, etc." The evidence is "Free from attachment to grasped and grasper..."

The second has explaining the antidotes that purify defilements and how the purified result arises from them. First has brief teaching and extensive explanation. First explains that the antidote purifying afflictions is the wisdom realizing the selflessness of persons, and explains that the antidote purifying cognitive obscurations is the wisdom realizing the selflessness of phenomena. As evidence for both, it explains all phenomena lack self.
First, [understanding] that the aggregates of suffering are impermanent, painful, and empty - these three realizations purify the defilements through wisdom, because they destroy the root, which is grasping to a personal self. Here, emptiness and selflessness are considered as one. Second, this supremely purifies the mind - the antidote to cognitive obscurations is the wisdom realizing the naturelessness of phenomena, because it destroys the root, which is grasping to a phenomenal self. Third consists of the reasons why [obscurations] need to be eliminated and the proof that they can be eliminated. First includes the reasons for eliminating afflictive obscurations and reasons for eliminating cognitive obscurations. First is as in "Just as a child in a womb..." Second is: "Just as a child in a womb, though present, cannot be seen, likewise the dharmadhātu, when covered by conceptual thoughts, cannot be seen." Conceptual thoughts are of two types: conceptual thoughts with nominal perception like thinking "pot," and conceptual thoughts with causal perception like thinking "round belly." Secondly, there is the actual [explanation] and explanation of the antidotes that eliminate [obscurations]. First includes the reasons for being able to eliminate samsaric concepts and the reasons for being able to eliminate nirvanic concepts. First: To counter the two obscurations, one must know that arising and what will arise are natureless, because the four [types of] conceptual thoughts of self and mine etc. are produced by causes - arising and what arises from arising. Second: If one wonders what eliminates conceptual grasping at characteristics in phenomena that arise through the power of compassion and aspirations rather than from causes and arising, [the answer is] they are abandoned through knowing that causes like aspirations and compassion are natureless. This shows that the aspiration prayers of the Buddhas and the form bodies and various pure lands that arise through their power are subject to conditions. They do not appear to the Buddha's own perception, and they lack defining characteristics that would identify them, because they constantly apply self-knowing primordial wisdom in meditative equipoise. The Buddha who possesses meditative equipoise has the nature of permanence, because it arises from that as its dominant condition. This passage identifying "the Buddha having the nature of permanence" teaches that while the ultimate kāya of the Buddha is identified, the various conventional kāyas that appear are natureless. It does not teach that buddhahood exists in the mindstreams of sentient beings, because there is no context requiring such an explanation and it would contradict the preceding and following passages. This passage eliminates conceptual grasping at characteristics in the result. Second has four parts: explaining that the general characteristics of all samsara and nirvana are mere imputations, showing that specific characteristics are not established, therefore characteristic-grasping is discordant with its objects, explaining this as the Buddha's intent of freedom from extremes, and inability to teach freedom from extremes. First: If one asks what is the antidote that eliminates conceptual grasping at characteristics in all phenomena arising from karma and afflictions and aspirations - just as conceptual grasping at a rabbit's horns imputes those horns which do not exist on its head, likewise all general characteristics of phenomena of ground, path and result are merely imputed by the conceptual thoughts that grasp them, and do not exist as they are imputed. Second: If one objects that this example is unsuitable because while rabbit horns lack specific characteristics, ox horns have specific characteristics, and likewise phenomena of samsara and nirvana have specific characteristics - ox horns are subject to conditions and their specific characteristics cannot be observed, because when analyzed in terms of subtle atomic nature they cannot be found. If one says that although not found there, they exist as gross entities - regarding those ox horns as subject to conditions, [continued]
What is to be examined? Just as before, in the state of subtle particles nothing was found, so too afterwards it remains the same, because there can be no inherently existing characteristics of imputed phenomena without a basis for imputation. Third, consider ordinary beings: how do you understand the individual and universal characteristics of phenomena? None of what you grasp exists. This is proven because all conventional phenomena arise dependently and cease dependently - they are dependently originated. Fourth, the Sugata establishes all phenomena of samsara and nirvana as the Middle Way free from the two extremes. How so? Through the examples of rabbit horns and ox horns. Mere conceptual designations exist even for rabbit horns, while inherent existence is absent even for ox horns. When analyzed by Middle Way reasoning, there is nothing that can be established by valid cognition. For this reason, being free from the two extremes of permanence and annihilation is designated as "the Middle Way."

Fifth, just as the forms of the sun, moon and stars appear as mere reflections in vessels of silver filled with clear water but are not seen as they actually are, likewise the complete characteristics of conventional phenomena are to be experienced through meditation, but consciousness cannot fully reveal their characteristics, similar to the previous example. The proof of this is that the dharmadhātu, which is virtuous in the beginning, middle and end, is seen accurately by the noble ones without deception. Since the dharmadhātu, which remains constant throughout all states of ground, path and fruition and is seen by the noble ones as selfless, ordinary beings conceive of self and mine in various ways, but what they conceive does not exist.

Alternatively, it can be explained: The second extensive explanation has two parts: how the Victor teaches definitive meaning, and how conventional designations are applied to that very definitive meaning once identified. First, if the wisdom of dharmadhātu pervades all three states, why isn't it taught that way in all the Buddha's teachings? The Victor's method of teaching is that those who need to be gradually led to definitive meaning must be taught through three stages - virtuous in the beginning, middle and end. Initially, to establish them in merit-concordant virtue, he teaches in accordance with the existence of personal and phenomenal selves. In the middle, to establish them in liberation-concordant virtue, he teaches the absence of both selves. Finally, he teaches that the wisdom of dharmadhātu which purifies the two obscurations and supports the two accumulations pervades all three states of ground, path and fruition. This teaching is infallible as it is pure through three types of analysis.

If one objects that the final teaching would be equivalent to the self posited by non-Buddhists since there is no difference in their way of explanation, [the response is that] regarding the wisdom of dharmadhātu taught finally by the Victor, since the Victor's method of teaching has stages virtuous in beginning, middle and end, and selflessness was already taught in the middle, how could it be conceived as self and mine? Second, regarding identifying that very meaning through examples: After identifying personal selflessness, it teaches how the conventional designation of person is applied to that very [selflessness]. After identifying phenomenal selflessness, it teaches how conventional designations of individual phenomena are applied to that very [selflessness]. First, while both innate ignorance and the self theorized by philosophical systems are negated for those in samsara, the self explained in the final turning...
When not even dharmadhatajnana is the self, one might ask: how can there be any basis for applying the terms 'buddha' and 'sentient being'? Just as summer water is called 'warm' while that same water in winter is called 'cold', similarly when obscured by the net of afflictions it is called 'sentient being', and when that same dharmadhatu is free from afflictions, it is called 'buddha'. This passage teaches how the terms sentient being, bodhisattva, and buddha are applied to dharmadhatajnana during the ground, path and result, and these three are also the referents for the ultimate definitive sentient being and so forth. Accordingly, the Uttaratantra also states: "Impure, both pure and impure, completely pure - these correspond respectively to sentient being, bodhisattva, and tathagata." These passages explain dharmadhatajnana at the time of the ground as sentient being, not as buddha. If both were explained as having the same basis, there would be no purpose for the definitive statement "When that same [dharmadhatu] is free from afflictions, it is called buddha." Second, if all phenomena of samsara and nirvana are empty of inherent nature, one might object this contradicts the appearance of the twelve inner and outer sense sources. The response has two parts: how conventional terms are applied to dharmadhatu, and summarizing their meaning. First: The six sense sources like form do not appear to consciousness as they actually exist. When analyzed down to atoms they are unfindable. When relying on the eye and forms, when clear form-appearances arise free from conceptual stains, those appearances are dharmadhatu itself, being without arising or ceasing. Yet subsequent conception knows and grasps them as "forms". Similarly, relying on sound and ear, clear sound-appearing consciousness arises through conception. At that time, that clear-appearing consciousness with its object is dharmadhatu itself, having no other defining characteristics. Yet due to subsequent conception it becomes grasping to heard sounds. Likewise for smell - just as form-appearances are without arising and ceasing, though not established as the nature of scent, nose consciousness grasps at dharmadhatu as being scent itself. The nature of the tongue is empty of inherent existence and the taste element is devoid of inherent nature. Though both, being of the nature of dharmadhatu, do not exist as causes for tongue consciousness, they are conceptually grasped as such. When analyzed, the pure physical body, the characteristics of tangible conditions it experiences, and the body consciousness freed from those conditions - all three are expressed as dharmadhatu. Conventionally, mental consciousness arises primarily in dependence on mind and mental objects. Though conceptual thoughts grasp at phenomena appearing to it saying "this is" and conventional terms are applied to what is conceptually imputed as "phenomena", they do not exist as imputed. The summary has two parts: meditating on all appearances as dharmadhatu, and through such meditation completely seeing the characteristics of dharmadhatu. First: Having abandoned conceptual grasping at conventional phenomena as forms and so forth through discriminating wisdom, one should meditate having understood phenomena like forms as lacking inherent nature. Second: The six sense sources - what is seen, heard, smelled, tasted, touched, and mental phenomena.
The eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and likewise mind - these six inner sense fields are naturally pure and empty in their own essence. This very emptiness is the individual characteristic of each of them. When a yogi understands that inner and outer phenomena are empty of inherent nature in this way, it is called understanding that all phenomena are of one taste in the dharmadhātu. At that time, the characteristics of phenomena are seen completely. In brief, the actual nature of the twelve sense fields like eye and so forth abides in the dharmadhātu, while their apparent nature manifests as eye and so forth. At that time, since the actual nature is dominant, the eye and so forth are only the dharmadhātu itself, not individually the eye, form and so forth.

Therefore, it should be understood thus: Form, as a phenomena, is form conventionally because it appears as form to a deluded consciousness tainted by the habitual tendencies of appearing as subject and object. Though it is form conventionally, according to our own system it is not form because it is the dharmadhātu, as it is empty of inherent nature.

Thus, while all knowable objects abide in their actual nature as dharmadhātu, and that very dharmadhātu exists inseparably with the primordial wisdom of the mind's dharmadhātu, in their apparent nature they are labeled according to whatever is imputed by innate ignorance. When contemplating the ultimate nature at that time, since all knowable objects are the dharmadhātu in their actual nature, they are the dharmadhātu. This does not entail that they are existent or ultimate truth and so forth, because at that time, if something is the dharmadhātu, it contradicts those various conceptual extremes.

With this meaning in mind, the extensive Mother [Prajñāpāramitā] states that there are no phenomena other than the dharmadhātu. Even when establishing our provisional system, while we accept that everything that exists is the dharmadhātu and ultimate truth, what is explained as conventional truth does not exist. Although we accept that the actual nature is the dharmadhātu, this does not entail it being ultimate truth. Just because its nature is ultimate truth, its conventional aspects and apparent nature need not be ultimate truth. This is because provisionally, since the two truths are definitely distinct, we must accept separately what is explained as the basis for their individual characteristics.

Thus, while we establish that if something is the actual nature it must be the dharmadhātu, this does not entail it being ultimate truth, just as emptiness is not pervaded by ultimate truth. If ultimate truth pervaded emptiness, the statement "Therefore, there are no phenomena whatsoever other than emptiness" would not be definitive.

Secondly, regarding how results arise from purifying the dharmadhātu, there are three points: How it ultimately becomes the dharmakāya, how the form kāya appears provisionally, and how all classifications of grounds, paths and results are designated on the state of the mind's dharmadhātu being purified of stains.

On the first point there are two: How ignorance arises when the mind's true nature is not realized, and how it becomes pure when realized. First, the mind of sentient beings is seen in two aspects: self-grasping and natural luminosity. The first is worldly, as saṃsāra arises from self-grasping. The second is transcendent, as it becomes wisdom itself when realized by self-cognizing primordial wisdom. 

On the second point, there are the actual [realization] and [understanding that] the result is not to be sought elsewhere. Regarding the first, if one asks how one becomes that when realizing it: When realizing it, attachment craving for existence and peace is exhausted. That dharmadhātu wisdom free of attachment is non-abiding nirvāṇa. Furthermore, when realizing it, afflictive anger...
When non-afflictive ignorance is exhausted and when those three are ceased through the power of wisdom, that is Buddhahood and the refuge for all beings. These are the ultimate fruits, for when the dharmadhatu wisdom is purified of stains, it is designated by names such as nirvana which does not abide in any state.

One's own dharmadhatu purified of stains is explained as complete enlightenment. That enlightenment is shown to be free from coming and going. Through the lamp of wisdom, one's own enlightenment is shown to be visible.

All samsara and nirvana are complete within this very body, because from knowing and not knowing the mind's dharmadhatu, these arise. How so? The mind's dharmadhatu bound by conceptual thoughts in one's own mindstream is characterized as samsaric, being the basis of designation for sentient beings. When one knows the dharmadhatu's own nature, one becomes freed from all conceptual thoughts. The dharmadhatu at the time of that liberation is characterized as freed from samsara, being the basis of designation for buddhas.

This text does not teach that buddhas abide in sentient beings' bodies, but rather explains that both samsara and nirvana arise from that. This is because the word "from" indicating source appears here, and also because the sutra states: "The primordial dharmadhatu is the basis of all phenomena. Because it exists, all beings and nirvana are attained." And in the Uttaratantra it explains "because there is buddha-nature" but does not explain that actual buddhas exist. When that dharmadhatu is explained as the element of both buddhas and sentient beings, this refers to it being the cause of both.

Enlightenment is not near to sentient beings because as long as the mind's dharmadhatu is not purified of stains, there will be no enlightenment. Yet it is not far either, because when the mind's dharmadhatu is purified of stains, it is established as enlightenment without needing to search elsewhere. A buddha's enlightenment neither goes to sentient beings' mindstreams nor comes from them, because the distinction between buddhas and sentient beings is established from seeing or not seeing this very dharmadhatu that dwells within the net of afflictions as buddha.

One must rely on the lamp of wisdom that realizes freedom from elaboration. Even after relying on it, one must gradually see the dharmakaya. If asked what method illuminates seeing that, abiding in the lamp of wisdom one sees one's own mind as supremely pacified of all elaboration, because without that wisdom realizing suchness in one's mindstream, through the power of the ten powers of wisdom blessing ordinary beings, when the mind's dharmadhatu becomes partially purified of stains, worldly beings see like the new moon - just as they see a small portion of the moon on the first day, they see a small portion of the Tathagata, because at that time a partial wisdom directly realizing suchness has arisen in their mindstream.

Regarding how the form body appears: For those lacking merit and wisdom, its appearance does not arise. Just as hungry ghosts see only thirst even when approaching the ocean, similarly although the buddha's form body has no coming or going, some beings, obscured by non-virtue and ignorance, mentally impute the non-existence of the buddhas' form bodies.
If some beings lack the eyes to see it, through the Buddha's compassion and skillful means it would be reasonable to show them appearances of his form and speech. However, for beings of weak wisdom and merit who lack the mirror of intelligence, what can the Blessed One do? Since the causes for appearances are incomplete and even if form bodies were manifested and dharma taught to them it would not benefit them. It is like placing a precious jewel in a blind person's hand - without someone to explain, it is no different than an ordinary stone. For such beings, it is taught that benefit comes through forms like Brahma, Vishnu, Mañjuśrī Kumara and others. But for those who cannot even perceive such appearances, benefit comes through the forms of spiritual friends, merchants, physicians and others - they are not abandoned. 

There are two aspects: how nirmanakaya appears to those with merit, and how sambhogakaya appears to those with wisdom. First, for beings who have previously accumulated merit, emanation bodies of the Buddha appear before them, radiant with light and blazing with the thirty-two major marks, and teach dharma and perform other activities. At that time, when the Lord's emanation body remains for many eons and then demonstrates passing into nirvana in order to train disciples, it is the wisdom of dharmadhatu itself appearing as distinct arising and ceasing, but the Tathagata has no coming or going.

As it is said "The dharmadhatu itself does not become different." This means that for the sake of training disciples, the Tathagata appears to those without the mirror of intelligence as arising and ceasing, but for the actual Tathagata himself, the dharmadhatu has no distinct arising and ceasing.

The meaning is this: When nirmanakaya appears to shravakas, pratyekabuddhas and ordinary beings, the aspect of form and speech that appears is a portion of their own mind's dharmadhatu enhanced by merit, so it is included within their own mind's phenomena. But the condition causing such appearances is the Buddha's dharmadhatu itself, which has no coming, going, increase or decrease.

As it is said: "This is the appearance of one's own mind, though ordinary beings do not know this. Nevertheless they see forms, and this becomes meaningful for them."

Therefore, for those who directly perceive dharmadhatu, there is no appearance of the form body passing into nirvana. For those who do not directly perceive it, such appearances depend on the increase and decrease of their own faith and merit. As it is said: "Forms appear and disappear to beings due to the power of their own pure or impure minds."

Second, there are two aspects: how the stages of purifying one's dharmadhatu are established as the ten bhumis, and how at each stage one's own wisdom appears as sambhogakaya with pure realms. First, when self-aware wisdom is completely purified of defilements, the ten bhumis exist as the nature of that wisdom. Having definitively realized the six outer sense fields as dharmadhatu, and the six inner sense fields as also being of one taste with dharmadhatu, self-aware wisdom progressively enters higher stages, thus establishing the bhumis. Second, the great Dharma Lord's supreme sambhogakaya realm, with bodies blazing with major and minor marks, and the dense array of Akanishtha...
The beautiful realm of enlightenment and the three wisdoms of the dharmadhātu possessed by bodhisattvas of the ten levels merge into a single taste. It is designated as seeing the sambhogakāya, as I, the treatise's author, explain. The meaning is this: The appearance aspect of the sambhogakāya with its abode is subsumed within one's own primordial wisdom. The reason it appears limited is due to the power of impurity from dualistic habitual tendencies within that wisdom. Although one's own wisdom is the causal condition for such appearances, the dominant condition is the wisdom of the buddhas. At the eleventh level, one's own wisdom and the wisdom of all buddhas merge as one, thus there is no distinction in the ultimate kāya, though different form body appearances manifest through the power of aspirational prayers.

Third, all virtuous qualities of the peaceful nirvana are shown to be states of the dharmadhātu itself. All phenomena of cyclic existence are shown to be states of the dharmadhātu itself. Therefore, one must know the dharmadhātu itself.

First, "Among the childish, the omniscient one..." and its continuum of merit and wisdom qualities, and "Among the noble ones, diversity..." refers to the distinctions of grounds and paths in their continuum. "The great lord Amitāyus" refers to the dharmakāya of complete buddhahood. All three, as stated in "Whatever causes the lifespan of eons," are the wisdom of dharmadhātu itself, uninterrupted until space ceases.

Second, the outer realm of sentient beings, the phenomena of samsara that remain for immeasurable eons, and the life force of living beings that endures - these too are protected by the wisdom of dharmadhātu. The meaning is that the lifespan or life force of all phenomena of both the afflicted and purified aspects is this wisdom of dharmadhātu itself. The purified phenomena merge inseparably with it and are held by it, while the afflicted phenomena abide in that ground in a way that allows for separation from it.

Third, there is the way that accords with the wisdom of purifying insight, the example of how to acquire wisdom insight, and the ability to remove obscurations to the acquired wisdom. First, from the inexhaustible cause, the dharmadhātu itself, arise the two inexhaustible results - the phenomena of samsara and nirvana. Due to the condition of ignorance, one engages for the sake of the first result. But through the distinction of wisdom realizing empty appearance, one should fully engage for the sake of whatever inexhaustible results are the phenomena of the purified aspect of that dharmadhātu.

Having thus engaged, enlightenment should not be considered far, for when the six sense objects are realized exactly as they are, without appearance, that itself is established as enlightenment. Nor should it be considered near, for when even one aspect of the stains of grasping the six objects remains impure, it is not established as enlightenment. The meaning is: "Not considering it far" means that when antidotes for purification exist, enlightenment need not be sought elsewhere. "Not considering it near" means that without relying on those antidotes, the dharmadhātu itself is not established as enlightenment.

Then, as it is said "Sentient beings are buddhahood itself," shouldn't one accept that this wisdom of dharmadhātu is naturally buddha? Although it is that, it cannot serve as buddha because the three kāyas are incomplete. If one asks whether the three kāyas are naturally complete, although they are complete, they cannot serve that purpose because they are not kāyas that have perfected benefit for others. Therefore, natural buddhahood...
Here is my enlightenment path, which is the cause of Buddhahood. If it exists merely in that way, it would amount to accepting the Samkhya philosophical system, because the Buddha nature that dwells in an unclear way during the time of being a sentient being must later be made clear through the power of the path.

Second, just as when milk and water are mixed together in one container, a swan drinks only the milk and not the water, similarly although both wisdom and ignorance dwell together here in the body, covered by afflictions, the yogi who knows how to separate the two takes the wisdom and discards the ignorance.

Third, how does one discard and take? Ignorance is twofold: confusion about the self that grasps at "I" and "mine" as a person, and confusion about the self of phenomena that conceptually imputes external objects as "form" and "sound." As an antidote to these, by seeing the two types of selflessness, the seeds of existence cease and one realizes the ultimate truth. To realize the dharmakaya, one must abide in the yoga that realizes the non-existence of the two selves, because these two types of confusion about self that are imagined by ordinary beings relate to the dharmadhatu which is the basis of Buddha, nirvana, purity, permanence and virtue.

Second, regarding how wisdom that purifies the elements depends [on other factors]: how the expansion of elements depends on engaged bodhicitta, and how awakening the potential of the elements depends on aspirational bodhicitta.

First, through various hardships: giving generosity, moral discipline that remains for the welfare of beings, and patience that benefits beings - these three expand the accumulation of merit for the wisdom of dharmadhatu. At that time, temporarily one sees the form body and ultimately accomplishes the form body. 

Similarly, diligence that delights in all supreme dharmas, concentration that single-pointedly engages with objects, and constantly relying on the wisdom that precisely discriminates phenomena - these three expand the accumulation of wisdom of the enlightened element. This allows one to temporarily see the naturally pure dharmakaya in one's own mindstream and ultimately accomplish the ultimate body.

Furthermore, wisdom together with skillful means, purified aspirations, definite abiding in the powers, and the perfection of wisdom - these four expand the accumulation of potential of the wisdom of dharmadhatu. These accomplish temporary tirelessness in benefiting others and ultimately perfect enlightened activity.

These ten are called the "expandable type" because they are the type that expands the potential of the naturally abiding lineage.

Second, some Sravakas who say "One should prostrate to the Tathagatas but not prostrate to Bodhisattvas" speak incorrectly, because without Bodhisattvas arising, the dharmakaya of the Tathagatas would not arise. For example, it is like someone who wants to refine molasses having aversion to sugarcane seeds. The example and meaning correspond: just as molasses cannot arise without sugarcane seeds, and sugar, molasses and candies arise from protecting, maintaining and cultivating sugarcane seeds, similarly by protecting and generating aspirational bodhicitta, maintaining it and earnestly cultivating its causes, perfect Buddhas newly arise and continuously emerge, and from that also arise Arhat Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas.
Just as Buddhas are born and arise, therefore just as brahmins make prostrations on the waxing moon, likewise disciples should make prostrations to bodhisattvas. To summarize their meaning: Just as farmers protect rice seeds and fertilizer, likewise the guide-like Tathagatas protect those bodhisattvas who are newly entered into the vehicle and have faith in supreme complete enlightenment. 

Regarding the gradual increase of the dharmakāya during the path: First is a brief explanation, then an extensive explanation. First is how those newly entered into the supreme vehicle see the dharmakāya conceptually, then the stages of directly perceiving dharmakāya after attaining the grounds.

First, just as on the fourteenth day of the waning moon, at the end of the twenty-ninth day, one sees just a slight circular light of the moon, likewise for bodhisattvas newly entered into the supreme vehicle who have faith, the dharmakāya is seen slightly in a conceptual way. This can be explained thus: The supreme vehicle is the Tathagata. There are four who have faith in it: ordinary beings, śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and those newly entered into the vehicle. They see the dharmakāya conceptually through faith in the Tathagata's qualities. This accords with the statement: "The ultimate of the self-arisen ones is to be realized through faith alone."

Second, just as the waxing moon is seen increasing moment by moment from the first through fourteenth days, similarly those dwelling on the grounds see the dharmakāya gradually increasing. And just as the moon becomes complete on the fifteenth day of waxing moon, similarly on the eleventh ground at the end, the dharmakāya becomes complete and clear.

These texts explain that when dharmadhātu wisdom is partially impure due to afflictions, that state is called "sentient being." When partially pure but not having given rise to bodhicitta, that state is called "śrāvaka" or "pratyekabuddha." When that mind arises, the state of realizing dharmadhātu through faith alone without direct perception is called "one who has faith in the supreme vehicle." From the point of partially removing the cognitive obscurations that obscure dharmadhātu until the end is called "bodhisattva." When completely pure of all obscuring stains at the end, it is called "perfectly complete Buddha."

Therefore, from the point of obtaining a portion of dharmakāya, one is designated "bodhisattva." Otherwise, if all beings had dharmakāya, there would be no certainty in the basis for applying the terms "bodhisattva," "sentient being," and "buddha." Mere partial purification of afflictions is not sufficient for establishing a portion of dharmakāya - both that purification and generating supreme bodhicitta must be combined. The proof is that without generating it, that element cannot be established as buddha-nature. The proof of that is there are four obscurations that obstruct establishing that element as essence, as stated: "Anger toward dharma, self-view, fear of saṃsāra's suffering, and disregard for beings' welfare - these are the four obscurations of the self-arisen ones."

The state where the essence is directly perceived is established as having the essence, because from then on the true nature of mind is established as Tathagata and dharmakāya. Similarly...
The meaning of "Thus Gone" refers to the direct realization of suchness, as it is said "Gone refers to the meaning of realization." Therefore, the dharmakāya, buddha, and tathāgata are established as the essence of various beings who possess that essence. Although the great translator Ngok maintains that by designating the empty nature of buddha and tathāgata with the term "essence," and the inseparability of that from beings' nature means all beings possess that essence, this is not well considered, as this alone does not comprehend the five purposes for teaching that all beings possess buddha essence.

If one asks: Didn't Noble Asaṅga explain that from the first bhūmi one sees all beings as possessing buddha essence? When one sees a portion of dharmakāya in one's own continuum from the first bhūmi, one sees that all beings' dharmadhātu can also be freed from stains like one's own nature - that is what is being expressed. At that time, since one sees they all possess that potential, it is said: "Because they possess the potential, all embodied beings always possess buddha essence." If one interprets this literally otherwise, all beings would contain perfect buddhas, since from the first bhūmi one sees them as present there. As it is said: "With unobscured wisdom that sees perfect buddhas dwelling in all, having objects of infinite beings."

If one objects that it is inappropriate to explain essence in terms of whether dharmadhātu is pure or impure, this is not inappropriate. For establishing dharmadhātu as essence, the ten aspects taught in the Uttaratantra must be complete. This requires purification of one part of the four stains to be purified, and expansion of the potential through conditions that awaken the element's capacity. Thus at the level of the ten bhūmis, although portions of dharmakāya, tathāgata and buddha exist, since they are not fully complete, it is difficult to establish them as having those defining characteristics. For example, just as the single portion of a first-day moon cannot be established as a full moon disc since it lacks the fifteen parts.

If one asks: Wasn't it explained that although all beings have essence they do not see it themselves? As long as one does not see that it exists there, one cannot establish its existence - like honey in a lotus grove. The extensive explanation has two parts: how bodhisattvas newly entering the vehicle see dharmakāya through faith alone, and explaining the stages of dharmakāya's development through the ten bhūmis.

First: Having properly generated bodhicitta through stable devotion to the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha at all times, when the dharmadhātu of mind becomes fully matured through conditions that expand it, since that dharmadhātu becomes just a general meaning of buddha essence, the bodhisattva newly entering the vehicle truly becomes irreversible from complete enlightenment.

Of the ten bhūmis, identifying dharmakāya on the first bhūmi: Having completely abandoned the black ground in the stage of devoted conduct and firmly grasped the white ground of mahāyāna methods and wisdom, when attaining the first bhūmi and realizing dharmadhātu as dharmakāya pure of stains in one part, one gives rise to special joy from being close to dharmakāya and able to effortlessly benefit others through the form kāyas.
First, this is known as the Ground of Perfect Joy. On the second ground, the dharmakāya is identified as that which, when purified of various defilements like desire that constantly stain the dharmadhātu, becomes stainless. At that time, this mind-dharmadhātu is called the Stainless Second Ground.

The dharmakāya of the third ground is identified thus: Having thoroughly ceased the web of afflictions on the second ground, the stainless and perfectly clear wisdom of the dharmadhātu of the third ground dispels infinite darkness, and is therefore called Light-Making.

The dharmakāya of the fourth ground is identified thus: The clear wisdom that was illuminated by the constantly pure light on the third ground is now thoroughly surrounded by the light of wisdom that has abandoned all distractions. Therefore, the dharmadhātu that has become the dharmakāya on this ground is known as Radiant.

The dharmakāya of the fifth ground is identified thus: Having mastered the five sciences, various arts, all crafts, and different types of meditation, and having conquered the extremely difficult to purify afflictions, the wisdom-dharmadhātu of this ground is known as Difficult to Overcome.

The dharmakāya of the sixth ground is identified thus: On this ground, having gained mastery over the three types of enlightenment, the accumulation of all excellent accomplishments, the cessation of birth and destruction, and the profound interdependent origination, this ground is called the Ground of Manifest Samsara and Nirvana.

The dharmakāya of the seventh ground is identified thus: Like the arrangement of a wheel, playing in all aspects with a web of wisdom light in the sequence of entering and arising from the dharmadhātu, having obtained unobstructed power to enter and arise from the dharmadhātu, and having crossed beyond the mire of the ocean of samsara, this ground is called Far-Reaching.

The dharmakāya of the eighth ground is identified thus: Having firmly grasped buddha-compassion, entered the ocean of dharmadhātu wisdom, gained mastery over non-conceptual wisdom, achieved effortless spontaneous accomplishment, and because its power cannot be moved by Mara's mandala, this ground is called Immovable.

At this ground, while one could manifest the dharmakāya that has abandoned cognitive obscurations by remaining in meditative equipoise on the dharmadhātu, since the accumulation of merit is not complete, one does not obtain the power to unceasingly and effortlessly accomplish others' benefit through the two form-kāyas. Considering this fault, buddhas rouse practitioners from cessation at this ground. Therefore, it says "Buddhas firmly grasp this certainty."

Even from the first ground, while this fault exists if one does not arise from the dharmadhātu, since afflictions are not abandoned in the impure grounds, one can arise without needing to be roused. But on this ground, since afflictions are abandoned, if one enters equipoise without first generating the intentional thought "I should arise," one might be unable to arise by one's own power, thus requiring the victors to rouse one.

The dharmakāya of the ninth ground is identified thus: Having gained mastery over all four perfect discriminations and reached the ultimate point of infinite eloquent discourse teaching the holy dharma, the ninth ground yogin is known as Perfect Intelligence.

The identification of the tenth ground's dharmakāya has two parts: the way of manifesting the dharmakāya in equipoise, and the way of receiving empowerment with the form-kāya in post-meditation. First comes the actual explanation and then paying homage to the tenth ground dharmadhātu in conclusion. First, from this stainless dharmakāya of the tenth ground, which is the nature of wisdom and equal to space, which perfectly holds the holy dharma of the buddhas, the holy dharma's...
Therefore this is called the Ground of the Cloud of Dharma. What is its nature? The tenth ground wisdom that fully grasps the buddha ground—which is the basis of the profound dharmakāya of all buddhas and the result of enjoying the vast dharma through the form body—is the dharmadhātu wisdom. What is the dharmakāya result that it grasps? As stated: "The basis is completely transformed; this is called the dharmakāya."

While the Bodhicittavivaraṇa refutes transformation of the basis, the distinction explained here is: there it refutes the Yogācāra explanation that transformation of the basis means the ālayavijñāna—which was previously the basis of all abandonment—later becoming not its basis. Here, transformation of the basis refers to that which previously lacked qualities later becoming endowed with qualities.

In brief, the nature of the tenth ground is the dharmakāya in which adventitious stains are partially purified, and its essence is dharmadhātu wisdom. Secondly, the dharmakāya is taught to be inconceivable and therefore worthy of prostration. First, no cognizing mind can know you, dharmadhātu, because you are utterly inconceivable.

If one asks whether the latent habitual tendencies of saṃsāra are also inconceivable like that—the habitual tendencies of saṃsāra are conceivable because when examining them with discriminating wisdom, one can know them as having the single taste of emptiness. The dharmadhātu free from habitual tendencies is inconceivable, as it transcends all domains of speech and is not the domain of any sense faculty.

If one objects that praising it would then be contradictory—I praise and prostrate to both the dharmadhātu that is conventionally designated, understood merely conceptually by mental consciousness, and the dharmadhātu that transcends what can be known and expressed. This text does not teach the dharmadhātu as an object of realization by mental consciousness, since it cannot be realized by conceptual consciousness. As stated: "Through negating seeing and so forth, it is accepted as inconceivable."

In brief, the phrase "either one" indicates both the dharmadhātu realized through mere faith at the level of devoted conduct and the dharmadhātu directly seen by individual self-aware wisdom upon attaining the grounds. Above, in the line "Just as on the fourteenth day of the waning moon," both ways of seeing the dharmadhātu—through mere faith and direct perception—were explained and both were described as dharma stars. The Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra also states "Without body and with body and attaining the body," teaching that even from devoted conduct one has the body.

Second, regarding how empowerment is obtained: the cause of empowerment, the manner of empowerment, and accomplishing enlightened activity after empowerment. First, when the renowned bodhisattvas of the tenth ground directly see emptiness, the true nature of phenomena, through the wisdom of the cloud of dharma, and when their ālayavijñāna mind is completely cleansed of the seeds of the two obscurations, they thoroughly transcend the net of coarse and subtle saṃsāra.

Second: the seat they sit upon, the retinue surrounding them, and the wisdom that empowers them. First, as stated in the Daśabhūmika Sūtra: "They abide on that seat of great lotus nature, with petals of various jewel lights, adorned with desired anthers, surrounded completely by millions of lotuses." The tenth ground bodhisattvas themselves sit on a throne adorned with many precious lotuses equal in extent to a billion world systems, and those lotuses...
In its retinue, the lotus is completely filled with [buddha-fields] equal in number to the atoms of ten billion trichiliocosms, and it is explained that bodhisattvas of the ninth ground and below are seated around it.

Secondly, on such lotuses, one's mind stream is completely filled with the ten powers, fully satisfied with the four fearlessnesses, and never deviating from the inconceivable qualities of a buddha such as the eighteen unique qualities, free from conceptual elaborations. Having thus accumulated the collection of wisdom and having accumulated the collection of merit through paths well practiced with body, speech and mind, these tenth ground bodhisattvas are surrounded by bodhisattvas of the first and other grounds in all aspects, like a full moon surrounded by stars.

Thirdly, "In that sun-like hand of the Buddha, stainless jewels blazed forth, bestowing empowerment on the chief of sons, conferring complete empowerment." As explained in the Daśabhūmika Sūtra, a light ray called "Omniscient Direct Perception" emerged from the buddha's ūrṇā hair along with hundreds of thousands of countless accompanying rays. After illuminating all ten directions, it dissolved into the crown of that bodhisattva, while the surrounding rays dissolved into the crowns of the retinue. It is explained that as soon as those light rays touched them, those bodhisattvas attained ten thousand samādhis they had not attained before.

Thirdly, "Dwelling in that great yoga, seeing with divine eyes those worldly beings diminished by ignorance, disturbed by suffering and afraid, effortlessly rays of light emerge from their body, opening the doors for those who have entered the darkness of ignorance." The "great yoga" refers to tenth ground bodhisattvas. "Dwelling there" means on that lotus seat. As explained in the Daśabhūmika Sūtra, countless hundreds of thousands of light rays emerge from their two soles, two kneecaps, navel, two sides of the ribs, and two palms, illuminating all the realms of hungry ghosts, hell beings, animals, humans, gods and demigods, pacifying all suffering.

The third section explains the dharmadātu at the time of fruition in three parts: explaining the wisdom of dharmadātu itself as nirvāṇa, how non-abiding nirvāṇa is established as the dharmakāya, and how enlightened activity spontaneously accomplishes from that. The first has two parts: the Śrāvaka schools' assertion of nirvāṇa and our own system's way of establishing it.

First, the Śrāvaka schools assert that arhats who have actualized nirvāṇa with remainder in three ways enter the sphere of nirvāṇa without remainder when they release their life force composite - they assert this is actualizing nirvāṇa. However, this is merely labeling the term on the exhaustion of saṃsāra and is not actual nirvāṇa, because it is not the dharmakāya. For establishing the dharmakāya, merely abandoning afflictions is not sufficient because even though saṃsāra ceases through that alone, if the cognitive obscurations are not partially purified, one does not see the dharmadātu, and without seeing that, one cannot establish the dharmakāya.

Second, in our own system, that very sphere of stainless mind is called non-abiding nirvāṇa itself, because being free from the stains of afflictions one does not abide in saṃsāra, and it is wisdom free from obscurations that do not depend on sentient beings.

Second, since that very essence of wisdom of dharmadātu where there is nothing whatsoever of the obscurations of all sentient beings is the domain of that very wisdom, it is only the experience of self-cognizing wisdom and cannot be expressed through words and concepts.
Transcending all objects of experience, such a doubly pure dharmadhatu is directly perceived by the faculties of enlightened mind. This doubly pure dharmadhatu is also called the utterly stainless dharmakaya, as it is the basis for all qualities like the powers. Third, when the ocean of wisdom qualities like the powers abides in the stainless dharmakaya free from adventitious defilements, from that arise the two form kayas which ceaselessly accomplish the welfare of beings. How? Just like a wish-fulfilling jewel with various shapes and colors.

Here it is said: Though drawn into samsara's ocean for long ages, without abandoning nirvana's peaceful wilderness, sustained by the food of undefiled bliss - how wondrous is the sage of the dharmadhatu forest! Good at first due to natural purity, good in the middle as dharmadhatu seeds grow, good at the end being full of qualities, good always due to wisdom itself. The youthful dharmadhatu maiden contemplating the wish-fulfilling tree adorned with qualities, drawn by the chariot of the learned mind, is seen here now with clear discriminating eyes.

This commentary called "Ascertaining the Dharmadhatu," explaining the treatise "In Praise of the Earth Element" composed by the great master Nagarjuna, was composed by the glorious Shakya Chogden, the teacher from Central Tibet's Gyurtsel monastery, who is fearless in analyzing the profound reality, during the first part of the month of Saga in the Year of the Earth Bird at Serdogchen in Upper Tsang's Right Horn. The scribe was Chokyi Gyaltsen.

Commentary on the Ultimate Bodhicitta, Called "The Essence of Madhyamaka Condensed"

Homage to Manjushri! To that great sun, the Mighty Sage, who with countless great strides of the emptiness chariot conquered hundreds of mountains of reification in the west, blazing brilliantly with love and compassion in the sky, I pay homage. Second Victor, when the hundred flavors of Manjushri's excellent teachings made the corpse of my discrimination taste-sensitive, and the lion's roar of composition resounded greatly, please protect me now! My discriminating intellect, never losing its youthful vigor, this sorrowless maiden, eagerly embraces the joy of constant companionship with speech that delights the noble ones.

After this dedication and commitment to compose, the teaching to be explained here is the treatise composed by Lord Nagarjuna called "Commentary on Bodhicitta." This has two parts: the reasons why this treatise needs to be clearly explained, and the actual explanation.

First: If this treatise is not clearly explained by my discrimination, people will not know that the bodhicitta which this treatise comments on is ultimate bodhicitta. They will identify the ultimate bodhicitta discussed here with the ultimate mind generation commonly known among dharma practitioners. They will mistake the mind generation ceremony explained here for a relative mind generation ceremony. Even those who don't make this mistake will erroneously think ultimate mind generation can be generated through ceremony alone. They accept the existence of self as Madhyamaka's own position. They accept that teaching selflessness of phenomena in sutras teaching Shravakas proves noble Shravakas realize selflessness of phenomena. They accept that external objects are established by valid cognition in the Madhyamaka Prasangika system. They don't accept the appearance of mind even provisionally as Madhyamaka's position. Some others think that Madhyamikas never refute meditating in that way even ultimately. Madhyamikas also affirm the alaya consciousness.
In terms of convention, some do not want to accept it, and some who understand this acceptance fail to distinguish whether consciousness is the basis of all defiled natures or not. Some distinguish whether or not to accept a truly existent alaya [consciousness] as a different substance from the six consciousnesses. Some assert that Nagarjuna's intention remains only in the Madhyamaka that follows worldly conventions, and not at all in the way of Yogacara Madhyamaka. When refuting truly existent mind, some accept that investigating where it exists - whether internal, external, in shape, color, male, female, etc. - is not the domain of discriminating wisdom. Some accept that meditation on emptiness and selflessness through discriminating wisdom is authentic Madhyamaka meditation, while considering non-conceptual meditation no different from sleep. Some accept as the Madhyamaka position that things exist conventionally but not ultimately. Some reject conventional emptiness as the Madhyamaka position. Some accept the two truths as one essence. Some do not accept ultimate bodhicitta as the characteristic base as long as there are presentations of ultimate truth. Some do not understand that what is explained here as ethics benefiting beings is taught as the stages of training in ultimate bodhicitta. Some wrongly conceive this as pertaining only to conventional bodhicitta generation.

Therefore, when explaining this text through one's own analysis and examining each word carefully, the purpose of this treatise called "Explanation of the Essence of Madhyamaka" is to dispel these various misconceptions.

Second, in explaining the actual meaning of the treatise, there are two parts: identifying bodhicitta through presenting the sutra to be explained, and the method of generating that in the mindstream after establishing its nature.

First: One verse beginning with "Free from all things..." This is spoken in the bodhicitta chapter of the Guhyasamaja Tantra. Each of the six perfect Buddhas taught a different type of bodhicitta. What is quoted here was spoken by Vairocana. What is their nature? One's mind is of empty nature - that is, the natural clear light. The proof that the mind's nature is emptiness is that it is primordially unborn. The proof of this is equality in being free from the duality of subject-object and the selflessness of phenomena. The proof that this is bodhicitta is because it is inseparable in essence from Buddha's wisdom. The proof that it is ultimate is stated briefly in "Free from all things" - this refers to the contaminated. This is explained in "Abandoned aggregates, elements, sense fields, and grasped and grasper" - meaning they are naturally pure. Thus, ultimate bodhicitta refers to the naturally luminous mind that remains unchanged in essence throughout the ground, path and result, rather than explaining it only as the wisdom directly realizing emptiness according to the textual explanation, as this text itself states: "Suchness, the perfect limit, signlessness, ultimate, supreme bodhicitta itself, and emptiness are explained."

Second has four parts: how to generate ultimate bodhicitta in the mindstream, establishing the nature of that mind, after generating that mind...
Through the method of aspiration, maintaining [the bodhicitta] as having a conventional aspect, and through meditation's power experiencing [it] as having an ultimate nature. First, just as all the Blessed Buddhas and great bodhisattvas generated the mind toward great enlightenment, likewise, from this time forward until reaching the essence of enlightenment, I will generate the mind toward great enlightenment. This should be proclaimed.

For what purpose is it generated? To liberate those beings not yet liberated from lower realms, to free those not yet freed from samsara, to give relief to those not yet given relief through emptiness and compassion as the essence, and to bring those who have not yet fully passed beyond sorrow to complete passing beyond sorrow.

Second, for bodhisattvas practicing in the door of secret mantra, after explaining as just stated, the conventional aspect - through the method of aspirational mental engagement - the ultimate bodhicitta having the nature of aspiration, having generated it as aspiration, that very ultimate bodhicitta suchness should be mentally engaged with, experienced and generated through the power of meditation. For this, since preliminary analysis through hearing and contemplation is necessary, the nature of that mind will be explained.

Although these immediate textual passages do not appear in some translations, they appear to accord with about seven translations including that of Patsab. Furthermore, the master explained it this way from many texts. Regarding these, others have made these mistakes: Saying there is no taking of ultimate bodhicitta through ritual; saying that since here it explains "through conventional aspect," this ritual must apply to conventional bodhicitta ritual; and since it mentions "bodhisattvas practicing in the door of secret mantra," claiming this is exclusively the mantra system and there is no ultimate bodhicitta ritual in the Paramitayana.

The first is incorrect because it contradicts what this great being himself clearly taught in the fourth chapter of the Fifth Stage about taking [bodhicitta] through ritual: "The worthy student who has received instructions, with joined palms holding flowers, should again take from the guru what is called ultimate bodhicitta - free from all things, aggregates, elements and sense spheres, abandoning grasping and grasped, through selflessness of phenomena and equality, one's mind primordially unborn, having the nature of emptiness." Then: "Afterwards, offer to the guru aligned gifts - jeweled houses, elephants, horses..."

The second is also incorrect because this is not the context for explaining that ritual, and because if "Through conventional aspect" necessitates applying it to conventional bodhicitta ritual, then "having the nature of aspiration" would absurdly necessitate applying it to aspirational bodhicitta taking.

The third is also incorrect because this same master who composed the treatise composed treatises applying the ritual of taking ultimate bodhicitta according to the Characteristic Vehicle system, and because the Dpang skong phyag rgya pa sutra also clearly explains the ritual for taking this.

Nevertheless, what is explained here is the mantra system, and "through conventional aspect" refers to contemplating the two minds in the form of moon and vajra. When explained this way, "bodhisattva" refers to the world...
Here's the English translation:

For an individual who has already generated conventional bodhicitta, the method of generating ultimate bodhicitta is taught according to the tantric tradition, as indicated by "at the door of secret mantra" and so forth. One might wonder if merely receiving it in this way means it has arisen in one's mindstream. It must be generated through the power of meditation, as explained in "the ultimate..." and so forth. One must distinguish between the existence of a ritual for ultimate bodhicitta generation and the inability to generate it through ritual alone. As the venerable Sakyapa said: "What is called ultimate bodhicitta arises through the power of meditation, but does not arise through ritual. For this, there are no three-part ceremonies of preparation, main part, and conclusion taught by the Buddha." Moreover, while the main part and concluding rituals are not explained in the Twenty Verses, the ritual just mentioned refers to taking ultimate bodhicitta merely through making commitment.

As it is said, although hundreds of rituals might be taught, they are commitments, not rituals. For example, it is said "giving should be practiced." Second, establishing its nature has three parts: expressing homage and commitment to compose, explaining its nature and showing the need to meditate on it, and the benefits of such meditation which destroys samsara and actualizes non-abiding nirvana. First is paying homage to the glorious Vajradhara, whose nature is the ultimate enlightened essence. Though this exists in all stages of ground, path and fruit, since the first two lack the spontaneous presence of the three kayas, the definitive one is that of the fruition state. Thus it is explained.

By whom? By me, the author of the treatise. What is to be meditated on? How to meditate on ultimate bodhicitta. What is the function of this meditation? To destroy existence. Here, existence is twofold: that of karma and afflictions, and that of the ground of ignorance and habitual tendencies. Thus, the first line indicates the subject matter of this treatise, and half of the second line indicates the necessity and connection implicitly.

The second has two parts: the teaching and the explanation. The first has two parts: identifying bodhicitta and showing it as the object of meditation. First: it is asserted. By whom? By the Buddhas. What? That ultimate bodhicitta. How? As having the characteristic of emptiness naturally pure and unobscured by adventitious concepts. What kind of concepts? The consciousness that grasps at self and aggregates as inherently existing phenomena.

Second: The ultimate bodhicitta generated through aspiration is the subject. One must meditate on the ultimate bodhicitta generated through effort with a mind moistened by compassion, because the compassionate Buddhas previously actualized non-abiding nirvana as the result of constantly meditating on ultimate bodhicitta with effort.

The explanation has three parts: how bodhicitta is empty of inherent nature, how to meditate on that emptiness with the meditating mind, and how through familiarization one becomes free from eternalism and nihilism. First: When analyzed with reasoning, the self imagined by non-Buddhists is not found anywhere within any of the aggregates. How so? Regarding the appropriated aggregates, conventionally only the aggregates exist, and these are not the nature of self because they are impermanent. This refutes the self and aggregates being the same substance. If one objects that although not the same, they exist as different substances in a supported and supporter relationship, this too does not exist. In no philosophical system can the permanent and impermanent two
Because there is no cognition of the container and contained as entities, there are two points: the invalidity of the basis of distinction and the invalidity of agency even if accepted. First, if one objects that without a self there can be no agent, when there is no self as the basis of distinction, how can there be the qualification of agency? In the world, analysis of phenomena only applies when there is a subject, not otherwise. 

Second, there is refutation through the sign of inability to function and refutation through the sign of contradiction with existence if permanent. First, that self imputed by ego-grasping as the subject neither exists as an entity externally nor internally. Because being accepted as permanent, it cannot function either gradually or simultaneously. If that self as the subject could function, it would simultaneously produce resultant entities. Whether dependent on conditions or not, it produces results. The reason is accepted: whatever functions as a different entity cannot be both permanent and efficacious.

Second, if self is accepted as an entity it cannot be permanent, since entities are always momentary. This reason was already established above by the sign refuting function in the permanent. If one objects that without a self, worldly agency would be impossible, the world that is free of self and person as the subject does not lack agency conventionally, because the possibility of agency in impermanent entities is not negated. This accords with the statement "All beings arise from karma."

Second, the refutation of the selfhood of phenomena has two parts: presentation and explanation. First, the aggregates, elements, sense-bases, and grasped-grasper are destroyed by wisdom. Second has three parts: how the three dharmas were taught as inherently existent for śrāvakas, how they were taught as appearing but lacking inherent existence for bodhisattvas, and the extensive explanation of reasoning refuting the inherent existence of the three dharmas.

First, if one objects that this contradicts the sutras teaching the existence of the three dharmas, there is no contradiction. The Buddhas, intending benefit, taught the five aggregates - form, feeling, perception, formations and consciousness - as inherently existent to śrāvakas. Here it must be explained according to the Mahāyāna.

Second, here the five aggregates are accepted as not inherently established. The Supreme One of Two Legs constantly taught: form appears like a bubble of foam, feeling is like a water bubble, perception is like a mirage, formations are like a plantain tree, and consciousness is like an illusion - thus teaching the aggregates as lacking inherent existence to bodhisattvas.

Third has two parts: identifying the characteristics of the three dharmas individually and extensively explaining the reasoning refuting their inherent existence. First, "The form aggregate is explained as having the nature of the four great elements." After identifying the form aggregate, the remaining entities are established as formless aggregates. The proof is that they necessarily do not arise without experience, etc. Those explanations of the characteristics of the aggregates can indicate the eighteen elements like eye and form elements. Whatever is explained as the eighteen elements should also be understood as the twelve sense bases and grasped-grasper.

The second has three parts: the reasoning establishing external objects as not truly existent...
In refutation of true external objects, just as in dreams where objects appear without existing, consciousness arises appearing as objects. Just as a single form can appear differently to different observers - as when ascetics, passionate ones, and dogs see a woman's corpse as a repulsive object, a desirable object, and food respectively - the Vaibhāṣikas' assertion of objects without aspects is refuted. Objects do not produce consciousness that appears as them, just as dream objects do not benefit or harm dream consciousness. Otherwise, dream objects would exist since there is no difference in how objects appear to both dream and waking consciousness, and consciousness depends on appearing objects. This refutes the Sautrāntikas' assertion of different external objects as causes producing aspects in consciousness. In brief, no external objects exist separate from consciousness. Due to the deluded nature of subject-object duality appearing, consciousness grasps as objects whatever appears to it. Therefore, while external objects are completely non-existent, forms, sounds etc. appear distinctly to individual consciousnesses and are conceptually grasped as forms etc. Just as deluded beings see non-existent magical horses, mirages, and gandharva cities, similarly forms and sounds appear while not existing. Regarding the explanation of the stages of realizing the two selflessnesses and establishing the non-true existence of wisdom - when asked whether the explanation of appearances as mental aspects conflicts with the Abhidharma's teaching on aggregates etc., and whether those aspects can be accepted as mind, there are three responses: teaching the three antidotes to self-grasping, explaining that mind-only was taught to dispel fears of nihilism, and showing that not all appearances are mind-only. The first response is that there is no contradiction, as the Abhidharma teaches aggregates etc. to counteract grasping at a personal self.
Here is the division being taught: great beings of the Mahāyāna temporarily dwell in the Cittamātra view and abandon the divisions of aggregates and so forth that are common with the Śrāvaka schools. When asked if those Mahāyāna practitioners who dwell temporarily in that state are solely Mādhyamikas, they are not. Both the Vijñānavādins who assert truth and the Sautrāntikas maintain that these various appearances are established as mind.

Secondly, ultimately these appearances are not explained as mind-only. After connecting the topics with "Now that nature will be explained," when the Sage taught that "All these three realms are mind-only," this was to eliminate the fear of childish beings, not because it is actually so.

Third has two parts: the reasoning common to the Alīkākāravāda and the scriptures unique to Mahāyāna. First, those appearances are not truly mind because the division into the three natures - the imagined, dependent, and perfectly established - is an analysis by wisdom of the naturally luminous mind that is of the nature of emptiness alone. The meaning is that when the dependent nature, like an illusion, is established as empty of subject and object duality in the single consciousness that is empty of subject-object duality, there is no dependent nature as a real entity separate from the perfectly established nature alone. As stated in the Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra: "Having realized through intellect that nothing exists apart from mind, one then realizes that mind too does not exist."

When explained this way, the Alīkākāravāda Yogācāras should not be called Cittamātrins since they do not accept appearances as mind. They are called Vijñānavādins because they accept the perfectly established nature as consciousness but do not accept the dependent nature as a real entity separate from that.

Second, for those who delight in Mahāyāna and have the Madhyamaka disposition, the Buddha taught in brief the equality of selflessness of phenomena. How was it taught? As stated in the condensed Prajñāpāramitā: "Mind has no mind, for mind's nature is luminosity." This teaches that mind is primordially unborn. Here, the non-true mind accepted by the Alīkākāravādins is definitely other-empty only, so to distinguish it from that, it speaks of "the equality of selflessness." The statement "mind has no mind" explains mind as self-empty, while according to the Alīkākāravādins, it explains that the conceptually imputed mind lacks an imagined mind.

Second has two parts: stating the assertion and refuting it. First, the Yogācāras who assert that only non-dual wisdom is ultimate maintain that in reference to their own ālayavijñāna consciousness, when the habitual tendencies or bases existing within it are completely transformed into pure mind or wisdom, that which becomes the object of self-aware wisdom alone truly exists.

Second has two parts: refuting the assertion of ālayavijñāna and refuting that non-dual wisdom is not empty of its own essence. First has two parts: refuting the Cittamātra assertion of ālayavijñāna and explaining how Mādhyamikas accept ālayavijñāna. First has two parts: showing the invalidity of transformed habitual tendencies in the ālaya and showing the invalidity of the ālaya as a basis for habitual tendencies.

First: Transformed wisdom does not truly exist because past bases or habitual tendencies do not exist in the ālaya since the future is unattained being unborn and the present remains as is. And in the present as well, how could there be complete transformation of bases? There is none.

Second: The ālayavijñāna does not exist as a basis for other contaminated phenomena because the ālayavijñāna lacks existence as its own entity, just as without a bowl...
Just as one does not rely on cypress trees, similarly the marks are established. The impressions on the alayavijñana do not appear to the six collections of consciousness just as they are, because how things appear to the six collections of consciousness is not how they exist in the alayavijñana. Otherwise, seeds would appear to engaging consciousness, and even non-seeds would be sufficient for engaging consciousness to experience. The meaning is that the alayavijñana as the subject is not a contaminated basis because it does not rely on you.

The second way of explanation takes mind that is clear and empty of the two selves as the subject. "There is no other consciousness as basis" means there is no other consciousness as support, making the non-reliance on seeds of other consciousness the property to be proven.

Connecting the above two lines as evidence: if appearances of form existed as impressions just as they appear, the blind would need to see forms, but they do not. And because impressions of things never previously experienced do not exist in consciousness just as they appear.

In brief, the Cittamatrins accept that the seed aspect of alayavijñana is a non-associated compositional factor and thus not ultimately real. Although they accept the clear awareness aspect as truly established, they do not accept it as substantially different from the six collections of consciousness, maintaining that the apprehending aspect of all consciousness is one entity.

Second, if asked what is taught by scriptural passages teaching alayavijñana, there are two answers: First explaining that although mind naturally luminous is empty of its own essence, it must be accepted conventionally as alayavijñana through examples of appearing non-empty. Although such is not consciousness, when depending on the body it is designated as consciousness.

First, just as iron quickly spins when near a magnet, at that time although the iron has no mind, it appears as if possessing mind. Similarly, that naturally luminous mind called alayavijñana, though empty of inherent existence by its own essence is not ultimate truth, yet when it comes close to taking a body, it appears like truth - going to birth places, coming from there, and causing that body it depends on to move. Therefore it holds existence.

The meaning is that luminosity as subject, though not a seed of birth places, when seeds take a body, is called alayavijñana because it holds existence and is first grasped by the body.

Second, just as the ocean moves though trees have no mind, similarly that naturally luminous mind called alayavijñana, though lacking the characteristics of mind, moves through the three realms depending on the body it draws. At that time when moving here and there, depending on body and senses, the six collections of consciousness arise and grasping at self arises. Therefore it is designated alayavijñana.

The Cittamatrins accept that although there is no body accumulating suffering, the other-empty alayavijñana exists by its own essence like an illusion. Here both exist equally conventionally since that is impossible without a body.

When explained this way, the Cittamatrins accept that consciousness which is the basis for imprinting habitual tendencies has two aspects - contaminated and uncontaminated wisdom. They accept the first as alayavijñana and neutral, but do not accept the second as such, instead accepting it as natural disposition, Buddha nature, and uncontaminated virtue. The Madhyamikas accept the first aspect just explained as alayavijñana, with characteristics that...
I will not accept [existence] in saṃsāra. As for the second aspect, the luminous aspect, it is called the ālaya and the tathāgatagarbha. Although the Cittamātrins assert it as the basis of all contaminated phenomena, it is not explained as the ālaya [here]. Rather, it is called that because it pervades the nature of all things.

Thus, in this system, since such an ālaya is accepted as having defining characteristics, consciousness is not a real entity because it lacks those characteristics. Therefore, the Madhyamaka and Cittamātra identify the ālaya differently. Taking the same basis of characterization, they fail to distinguish between accepting and not accepting true existence. This is because even the ultimate philosophical system of Yogācāra does not accept consciousness as truly existent.

If one objects that when explaining their philosophical system, didn't they say "Ultimate consciousness, free from subject and object, exists"? This explanation was intended for those who do not accept it as empty of itself, just as explained in Madhyamakāvatāra regarding the assertion that dependent nature exists by its own essence.

If one objects that it's contradictory to assert both existence by own essence and emptiness of true existence, in that system there is no contradiction because they explain the main meaning of emptiness exclusively as "empty of other." Although that system accepts the imaginary to be empty of itself, that emptiness is not efficacious, like a barren woman's child being empty of itself.

Thus, in that system, only the thoroughly established nature exists truly. Its basis of characterization is what is called non-dual wisdom, and this alone is the basis of dispute between Madhyamaka and Cittamātra regarding true existence. There is no error in explaining that the supreme wisdom free from subject and object exists ultimately. They explain that the proof of its existence by own essence is that it is experienced by self-cognizing wisdom.

Secondly, regarding establishing that very wisdom as empty of itself, there are two points: there is no proof that it is not empty of itself, and there are refutations. First, when one thoroughly analyzes and establishes that "without a physical basis, consciousness depending on it cannot exist," how can one assert in the Yogācāra system that non-dual consciousness, the object of self-cognizing wisdom, exists by its own essence? One cannot state its proof because consciousness as subject cannot arise without depending on an object. Mādhyamikas cannot show how Yogācāra's non-dual wisdom exists because they say it is known by self-cognizing wisdom itself. Since they assert that object of knowledge as a real entity, and since it's said they cannot express "this is that" verbally, the pervasion is established for your mind. Just as certainty exists for the opponent themselves, in order to generate certainty in others, the wise must always use unmistaken expressing words that can show the meaning to be expressed exactly as it is, because they engage in verbal expression.

If one objects that don't Mādhyamikas also explain it as "inexpressible by speech and thought" and "the domain of self-cognizing wisdom"? In this system, the experience of wisdom is merely imputed as self-cognition since nothing whatsoever is observed as an object of experience - they don't assert that experienced object as a real entity.

Secondly, it is unreasonable to accept that consciousness as subject exists without its objects of knowledge because knower and known are posited in mutual dependence. If consciousness cannot arise without an object, then asserting non-dual wisdom as self-cognizing is unreasonable because without an object there is no known and knower.

If one objects that this applies equally to you, in conventional terms...
Since there are objects, there are consciousnesses that engage with those objects, and there is self-awareness that experiences them, but ultimately none of these three are accepted. Therefore, the term "non-dual consciousness" is not elegant. Although the Mind-Only school accepts empty appearance-consciousness devoid of subject and object as other-empty, they assert that since its essence is not empty of the grasping aspect, appearance-consciousness exists by its own essence. The proof of this having three special characteristics, while not established by other valid cognitions, is self-awareness. They claim the proof of self-awareness is that memory arises later observing the subject. To this, the Madhyamikas respond that since that is not established, it cannot prove awareness, like the son of a barren woman. Memory is also not valid as a reason because conventionally memory arises for objects too, and ultimate memory is impossible.

Third, regarding establishing the unreality of Mind-Only: First addressing direct objections. First, proving it through the reason of being nothing other than mere names. Second, proving it through the reason of being unfindable when searched for. Third, proving it through the reason of not being established as shape etc. Fourth, summarizing the meaning of all these.

First: Subject: mind - it is mere name, because nothing exists apart from names. Second: Mind and mental factors are explained as the aggregate of names. If asked whether they are true as mere names - Subject: even the view of Mind-Only as mere names - lacks inherent nature because it is imputed.

Third: Subject: mind - is empty of its own essence because it does not exist as color, shape, subject, object, male, female, neuter etc. Regarding this, others say: "The consciousness examining whether pointed horns are on a donkey's head or horse's head is a consciousness examining the nature of horns, because it is awareness examining where shape and color exist." This contradicts the just-explained text and is logically invalid as an example. First, according to you, although it doesn't exist in either of those two, one thinks it exists on something like a buffalo's head. Then the reasoning examining where true oneness or multiplicity exists would also not be that, because although not existing there, it exists on buffalo-like heads. Second, while thinking mind conventionally lacks shape, color etc., by that logic the examination of where mind exists as true one or many would not be that, because you don't accept it conventionally exists as those.

Fourth: In brief, subject: mind - is of the nature of lacking inherent nature, because Buddhas did not see your nature in the past, will not see it in the future, and how could they see it in the present, being devoid of shape etc. If you think there's no fault since they see it as mind itself - they must see it as luminous, and seeing it thus they must see it as empty. Seeing its mind as devoid of shape etc., they must see its essence as awareness. Seeing it thus, they must see it as luminous-empty without grasping. Seeing it thus, they must see its nature. Therefore the reasoning searching for mind's nature explained in this text is correct.

The wrong conception of mind as having the nature of shape and color exists in Samkhya, because they assert the self as consciousness, white in color, dwelling in the heart, the size of Canaka's fruit, as omniscient. Who would assert pointed horns exist on donkey etc. heads? Second, regarding abandoning objections - since conventional truth objects don't exist, their subject consciousnesses...
Although they appear non-existent, since empty objects exist, the subject consciousness also exists.

On this point, there are two ways of establishing our own system conventionally: provisional and ultimate. First, regarding conventional things, both object and subject consciousness that act as antidotes to conceptual grasping exist generally, and specifically they are accepted as ultimate truth. Ultimately neither is accepted, because no extreme of elaboration whatsoever is accepted. Thus, ultimately when there are no assertions whatsoever regarding definitive meaning, this itself is designated as the ultimate Madhyamaka system, just as seeing nothing is designated as seeing space.

In this context, speaking from the ultimate perspective: How can there be a valid way of establishing emptiness when conceptual appearances that say "it exists" arise? Grasping at things or existence is conceptual thought. In emptiness there is no conceptual thought. Where there is an object of thought and a thinking mind, there is no enlightenment, because the Tathagatas do not see minds of conceptual objects and subjects. Thus space, the ultimate enlightened mind, and natural enlightenment or nirvana are said to have the characteristic of non-duality, because they lack defining characteristics, do not arise from other causes, do not exist inherently, and are free from the path of expressing speech. 

If asked who knows this - those dwelling in the essence of enlightenment, the great beings who rest evenly in suchness, the Buddhas and noble Bodhisattvas with compassion know emptiness as equal to space throughout the three times.

Second, regarding how to meditate on emptiness, there are two aspects: the meditation system of Madhyamaka itself and the refutation of incorrect Yogacara meditation on emptiness. The first has two parts: showing the need to meditate and how to meditate. First, emptiness free from elaboration is naturally peaceful and functions like an illusion, so one should always meditate on this empty emptiness. The purpose is to destroy cyclic existence. If asked whether it destroys what previously existed - it is baseless existence. If asked whether this contradicts the appearances of various good and bad rebirths - there is no contradiction because emptiness is the basis of all conventional phenomena.

Alternatively, it can be explained: Because emptiness is the basis of all conventional phenomena that is naturally peaceful and appears like an illusion without basis, destroying cyclic existence, one should definitely always meditate on emptiness.

On the second point: First refuting mistaken meditation on emptiness, then explaining unmistaken meditation. First: Taking as objects of focus "there is no arising," "it is empty," "there is no self" - such meditation is not sufficient wisdom meditating on emptiness, because it is merely an inferior meditation on the nature of emptiness. Although this meditation helps counter grasping at truth, it forcefully gives rise to a mind attached to non-truth. This means meditation becomes conceptual imputed grasping.

Second: If asked how to meditate - As long as thoughts are not eliminated, sufficient meditation on emptiness will not arise, because the Buddhas taught the characteristic of cessation of virtuous and non-virtuous conceptual thoughts, and do not accept those objects grasped by other concepts as emptiness. If asked how then - having settled emptiness through hearing and contemplation...
In meditative equipoise, the cultivation of emptiness refers to meditating on space, because the mind in equipoise dwells in wisdom without grasping at any object of focus, which is the characteristic of space. It is like saying "dwelling in space," which is conventionally attributed to not dwelling anywhere.

The Yogācāras say that the nature of emptiness is awareness, and that it is only empty of others but not empty of its own essence. This itself is the object of wisdom meditation and direct yogic perception. They say there is no characteristic of direct perception in conceptual cognition that eliminates other phenomena.

To refute this, there are two points: explaining that emptiness must mean self-emptiness alone, and that the nature of wisdom is momentary and must be accepted as self-empty, and that self-emptiness alone is taught as the nature of phenomena.

First, wherever the lion's roar of emptiness dwells, terrifying all realists, there the dharma of emptiness is taught. This is not found among those who speak only of other-emptiness.

Second, it is contradictory for Yogācāras to accept mind as momentary while rejecting self-emptiness. In any philosophical system that asserts consciousness as momentary, that mind must be impermanent. If that impermanent mind has no opportunity to remain even for a moment through its own essence, how could it contradict self-emptiness? It must be empty. In brief, why would the perfect buddhas not accept mind as self-empty, since the buddhas accept mind as impermanent? The pervasion is as stated: "The meaning of impermanence is the meaning of non-existence," because it explains that there is no opportunity to remain even after arising.

Third, if one objects that accepting mind as essentially empty would become nihilism like the Cārvākas - this is not similar because the Cārvākas accepted nihilism in relation to conventional reality, while here we are considering the ultimate nature.

When explaining that declaring something inherently established to be without inherent nature would be nihilistic, this is not what is being stated. Rather, mind has been established as naturally non-existent from beginningless time. The proof of this is that when we say mind is beginninglessly impermanent, mind has abandoned remaining for even a moment in its own essence. Having abandoned that, it transcends and lacks its own nature. This lack of inherent nature is not a non-phenomenon - it is the meaning of self-emptiness.

If one objects that while impermanent phenomena are established as self-empty, permanent ones are not - according to the Madhyamaka treatises, the ultimate nature of all phenomena is accepted as emptiness. Just as worldly ultimate truth is posited as sweetness being the nature of sugar and heat being the nature of fire. Moreover, while according to worldly convention, that heat possesses three characteristics of nature in relation to fire, according to the Madhyamaka treatises, fire's emptiness of heat possesses three characteristics of nature. The three characteristics are, as stated: "Nature is unconditioned and independent, and nature never transforms into something else."

Third, showing that understanding self-emptiness liberates from eternalism and nihilism has two parts: overcoming direct objections and overcoming debate.

First, in this system explaining all phenomena as self-empty: Some say there is the fault of nihilism, but while that would follow if one accepted an established phenomenon as self-empty, since emptiness that has never experienced its own essence is expressed as the nature of all phenomena [this fault does not apply].
That being the subject, they do not assert anything as permanent. Since they assert that emptiness of inherent existence is the nature of all knowable phenomena, there are two parts to this: showing that accepting emptiness of inherent existence does not incur the fault of severing conventional reality, and showing that accepting conventional reality does not require seeking emptiness separately.

First, regarding the objection that if all phenomena are empty of inherent nature, there would be no agents performing actions, experiencers of results, sprouts arising from seeds, or development of wisdom through hearing and contemplation from the condition of hearing teachings - the response explains how dependent origination of persons and phenomena is accepted, thereby freeing one from the fault of negating conventional reality.

First is how to establish the dependent origination of persons and phenomena. This has three parts: presentation, explanation, and summary. First, there is no fault because the twelve links of dependent origination, from ignorance through aging and death, appear as consciousness but lack existence as wisdom, like dreams and illusions, as asserted by the treatise authors.

Second has two parts: showing dependent relations exist from the perspective of delusion, and showing they do not exist from the perspective of reasoning. First, as long as afflicted ignorance is not abandoned, the wheel of the twelve links appears to turn on the path of cyclic existence, since no beings in the state of peaceful nirvana are said to experience karmic ripening results.

Second, the wise definitely assert that the aggregates that link rebirths neither take birth nor transfer to other lives. The Victor taught this conventionally, in deluded terminology. Just as conventional phenomena that are like agents are empty of inherent existence, so conventional phenomena that are like experiencers of karmic results arise as consciousness while being empty of inherent existence.

Regarding how external dependent origination is established: briefly showing similarity to illusions, extensively explaining appearance while lacking inherent nature, and summarizing after identifying conventional truth. First, just like internal dependent origination explained above, external dependent origination is also asserted to be like dreams and illusions. Sounds of drums and rice sprouts arise from their assembled causes and conditions, while that assembly is known even by realists to be empty of inherent existence.

Second, just as when a face appears in a mirror, the face does not transfer to the mirror, and without a face there would be no reflection, similarly...

In brief, conventionally there is no contradiction in agents producing results arising from causes, since when establishing conventional truth, the way things appear to consciousness not affected by temporary distortion is authoritative. Ultimate wisdom realizes these results do not truly arise. Since productive causes are impermanent, they are empty of inherent existence. When the non-arising of results is established, emptiness is also established, since the lack of inherent arising of phenomena is explained as their emptiness.

Third, what are these phenomena explained above as existing as consciousness but not as wisdom? In brief, they are explained as the five aggregates that comprise all phenomena.

Second, those five aggregates appear as the nature of both types of consciousness while lacking inherent nature.
When explained according to how it is, the continuum of conventional truth is not interrupted. If conventional truth exists as the nature of consciousness, then one would need to search for wisdom's emptiness separately. However, emptiness is not observed as separate from conventional truth, because conventional truth itself is explained as emptiness, and emptiness itself, whose nature is not experienced mentally, appears to consciousness as conventional truth. Without being empty of its own nature, the various appearances of dependent origination would certainly not arise, like the impermanence of compounded things. Later Tibetans who claim this text teaches the example of the two truths being of one nature are mistaken, because after accepting the conventional nature, the ultimate nature cannot arise. If one does not accept conventional truth as self-empty, from where would one seek the ultimate nature? Therefore, this text teaches that if conventional truth is not empty of its own nature, these various dependent appearances of conventional truth would not arise either, as stated: "For whom emptiness is impossible, for them nothing is possible."

The third section teaches that by understanding and familiarizing with emptiness, samsara is destroyed and non-abiding nirvana is actualized. This has two parts: teaching that through understanding and familiarizing with emptiness, one can actualize non-abiding nirvana, and teaching that through this one is liberated from samsara. The first has two parts: teaching that this can eliminate the latencies of the two obscurations, and teaching that after eliminating these, one actualizes the perfect limit.

The first explains: These deluded conventional appearances arise from afflictions and karma. Karma arises from mind. Mind is called "mind" from the aspect of being filled and accumulated with latencies, and from the aspect of being empty of that, it is called "luminous mind." Being free from latencies is happiness and virtue. The happy and virtuous luminous mind is peace itself. The peaceful mind, free from all conceptual thoughts, does not become deluded. In non-deluded wisdom, there is what is called realization of suchness. Through realizing and familiarizing with suchness, one attains and actualizes ultimate liberation.

Here there are two types of latencies: seeds and negative tendencies. Each has two aspects: afflictions and the appearance of subject-object duality. These two are the causes that proliferate conventional appearances - one causes the proliferation of internal dependent relations, the other of external. Here, latencies and seeds are not as the Mind-Only school asserts. What are they then? Seeds are the empty nature of that specific mind-stream that has not yet given rise to the wisdom that is the antidote to what is to be abandoned. Latencies are the reappearance in mind of the memory of previous actions. Therefore, we do not accept latencies and seeds as arising like a river's continuous flow.

Second, through becoming familiar with and habituating to emptiness, when it becomes inseparably mixed with the familiarizing mind such that dualistic consciousness finds no opportunity to arise, then this is called actualizing emptiness. This is also called actualizing the perfect limit, naturally occurring nirvana, and the ultimate bodhicitta, because these are taught as synonyms for suchness, perfect limit, signlessness, ultimacy, and the emptiness of supreme ultimate bodhicitta. These various terms are used when applying conventional terminology of valid cognition, but not when cutting through elaborations through view, because if at that time emptiness is accepted as ultimate, the extreme of elaboration...
If one becomes unsurpassed, regarding conventional designations, there are two: the intermediate refutation of self and the final refutation of all views. Regarding the latter, although there are assertions belonging to the method aspect, there are no assertions or commitments dominated by views. As it is said: "If I had any commitments, then I would have faults. Since I have no commitments, I am completely without fault."

Second, those beings who do not understand emptiness - the selflessness of persons and phenomena in their own nature - are not shown ultimate liberation in their current state. Because they are deluded about the self of persons, these beings circle in the prison of the six realms of existence.

Third, when that mind arises, there are two ways of accomplishing the welfare of beings: teaching and explanation. First, one might ask: "If one becomes accustomed to emptiness, won't benefit for others be interrupted?" No, because as explained above, when yogis meditate on emptiness, there is no doubt that minds of attachment to others' welfare arise.

Second has two parts: showing that emptiness should be meditated upon with compassion as its essence, and showing that by such meditation one realizes nirvana without abiding. The first has two parts: showing the fault of falling to the extreme of annihilationist nirvana if one meditates on emptiness without benefiting beings, and showing that the two inferior nirvanas cannot serve that purpose.

The first has two parts: showing that benefiting beings is a training in ultimate bodhicitta, and showing that realizing emptiness directly is not contradictory with taking birth in samsara. The first has four parts: showing the need to accomplish benefit for beings, showing the need to abandon detachment from beings, showing how the compassionate naturally engage in others' welfare, and the summary.

The first has three: showing the need to repay past kindness, showing the need to give happiness to others to atone for past harms, and showing the need to accomplish benefit for others because all happiness and suffering arise from helping or harming beings.

First: One should repay the kindness of those beings who in the past benefited oneself as fathers, mothers, and friends. Second: Just as I gave suffering to beings burning with the fires of afflictions in samsara's prison through harming them, similarly and likewise I should give them happiness.

Third has exposition and explanation. First: All desired results of higher realms and undesired results of lower realms arise from helping or harming beings. Second has two: showing all happiness comes from benefiting beings and showing all suffering is the result of harming them.

First: If even the unsurpassed state of buddhahood is attained in dependence on beings, what is amazing about the fact that none of the enjoyments of gods and humans, and the supports of Brahma, Indra, Rudra, and the world protectors, are drawn forth without at least helping beings in these three higher realms?

Second: The various kinds of suffering experienced by beings in the hells, animal realms, and hungry ghost realms arise from harming beings. Even in the higher realms, suffering that is difficult to reverse and endless through hunger, thirst, beating and oppressing each other is the result of harming beings. Thus, higher and lower realms are the nature of ripening results of help and harm to beings.
Having recognized this, Buddhas rely on bodhicitta itself with all things and protect beings like their own bodies. Regarding the second point, detachment from sentient beings should be abandoned with effort like poison. As evidence for this, through detachment the śrāvakas attain only inferior awakening. By not abandoning sentient beings completely, perfect buddhahood is attained. To summarize the meaning: having analyzed the results that arise from benefit and non-benefit, how can one remain attached to self-interest even for a moment? Third, regarding the teaching and explanation: First, perfect enlightenment arising from the sprout of ultimate bodhicitta rooted in the teaching of compassion is solely for the benefit of others - thus do the children of the victors meditate. Second, one who through meditating on emptiness with a core of compassion develops stable altruistic mind, driven by others' suffering, abandons even meditative bliss and enters even the avīci hell. This being amazing, it is praiseworthy. For those who act thus, giving their bodies and wealth to beings is not amazing, since as just explained, this is the supreme way of the holy ones. Fourth, having understood that phenomena are empty by nature, teaching karma and its results exactly as they are is more amazing than amazing and more wonderful than wonderful, because having realized the non-contradiction between appearance and emptiness, one trains in the precepts of ultimate bodhicitta. Not only is this way of engaging in others' welfare a precept of ultimate bodhicitta, but the teaching method here focuses solely on this aspect, because the main result of enlightenment must be explained as perfecting both purposes, and if not taught as its precept, exclusively emphasizing ultimate bodhicitta risks falling into the extreme of annihilationist nirvāṇa. Second has two parts: showing that though born in saṃsāra one is unstained by saṃsāra's faults, and showing that though abandoning the afflictive causes of birth there, one can still take birth there. First: Those with the intention to protect beings who directly realize emptiness, though born in the mud of existence, like lotus petals unstained by water are unstained by the faults arising from existence, due to directly realizing emptiness. Second: Though the children of the victors like Samantabhadra and Maitreya have burned the firewood of afflictions, nevertheless, those who have become medicine through compassion and are controlled by compassion enter the mother's womb, take birth, engage in play, leave the palace, practice austerities, manifest great enlightenment, conquer Māra's forces, turn the wheel of dharma, remain in all divine abodes, and likewise demonstrate passing into nirvāṇa. Similarly, through activities taming beings, they perform the dance of existence manifesting as Brahmā, Indra, Viṣṇu, Śiva and others. Who does this? Those of compassionate nature. Second: Though not working for beings' welfare, by meditating on emptiness one can actualize ultimate nirvāṇa, like nirvāṇa without remainder. In response, there are four points: showing this nirvāṇa is not sufficient; showing one must then enter the Mahāyāna path; explaining the causes for taking birth in existence after entering it; and dispelling objections to this. First, regarding inferior nirvāṇa...
This wisdom with and without remainder taught there is interpretive meaning, not ultimate truth. The basis for interpretation is that it serves as a method arising in the Mahayana. The purpose is to provide rest for those weary of samsaric paths. 

Until awakened by the Buddhas, those Arhat Shravakas, possessing wisdom bodies, remain intoxicated in samadhi and abide in the realm without remainder. When awakened by the Buddhas, they generate bodhicitta through various forms and become attached to benefiting beings. Having accumulated merit and wisdom, they attain complete buddhahood.

This text teaches that the essence of inferior nirvana is wisdom. As for what causes them to take birth in samsara - due to having latent imprints of ignorance and undefiled karma, these latent impressions are termed "seeds" - merely designated by name. When the conditions for these seeds gather, they produce the sprouts of existence. Thus, as taught in the Shrimala Sutra, for empowered bodhisattvas and arhats who have attained nirvana without remainder, these latent impressions are the cause for taking birth in samsara.

When emptiness with the essence of compassion alone is the main cause of complete enlightenment, and even after attaining nirvana without remainder one must train in that path, what is the reason all Buddha's teachings don't solely teach emptiness with the essence of compassion? In response: It's taught that many aspects of Dharma were taught considering the individual minds of disciples. All of these are shown to be unified as emptiness with the essence of compassion. All divisions of grounds and paths are shown to be aspects of that very nature. By meditating thus, one is freed from the extreme of annihilationist nirvana.

The World Protectors taught the holy Dharma through many methods and aspects in the world, as it must accord with beings' different minds. Though taught as profound in some cases, vast in others, or having characteristics of both, etc. - these many different teachings are not separate from emptiness with the essence of compassion, as they are non-dual with it. The dharanis, grounds, and paramitas are taught by the omniscient ones in the Dashabhumika Sutra and others as aspects of ultimate bodhicitta of emptiness with the essence of compassion.

Having directly realized emptiness, constantly benefiting beings through body, speech and mind as explained above - you are free from the fault of falling to the extreme of nihilism claimed by those who argue about emptiness, since you do not actualize the ultimate truth until completing development, maturation and purification. 

Great beings who have cultivated emptiness with the essence of compassion for three countless eons - the ultimate enlightenment you actualize is explained in this Mahayana Dharma as nirvana without abiding, as it does not abide in the extremes of samsara and nirvana.

The praise of bodhicitta has two parts: praise and dedication of merit. First is praise for being able to continue the Buddha's lineage and praise for being the chief factor establishing the Mahayana.
The supreme cause accomplishing both one's own and others' benefit, source of immeasurable merit, and supreme among all wealth - therefore one should cultivate bodhicitta.

The essence of emptiness, mingled inseparably with the taste of great compassion, becomes the source of abundant merit and wisdom. Those who drink from it for the purpose of accomplishing their own and others' benefit are children of the Victors, capable of continuing their lineage. Therefore, with all actions of body, speech and mind, one should constantly bow and prostrate to bodhicitta. Whatever offerings exist in the three realms of existence are worthy to be constantly offered. For the sake of continuing the Buddha's lineage, I beseech these world-leaders to remain forever.

This bodhicitta is explained as the distinguishing dharma of the Mahayana. Therefore, with mind evenly placed, through physical and verbal effort, generate ultimate bodhicitta with compassion at its core.

For accomplishing one's own and others' benefit, there exists no other method in all of existence besides this emptiness with compassion at its core. The Buddhas have not seen any other method for bringing the two benefits to completion besides bodhicitta.

The merit of merely generating bodhicitta, if it had form, would exceed even that which could fill all of space, as stated in the sutras. The merit accumulated by whoever meditates on bodhicitta even for a moment cannot be measured even by the Victorious Ones.

This precious undefiled bodhicitta is the singular supreme wealth as it gives rise to all needs and wishes. Demons of afflictions and other thieves cannot harm or steal it, as it mingles inseparably with the mind of the practitioner.

Just as the aspirations of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas remain unshakeable in samsara for those whose minds are inclined toward bodhicitta, you too should strive in what has been explained with wonder-filled minds. After doing so, you will yourself realize and attain the conduct of Samantabhadra.

May those beings drowning in the churning waves of the ocean of existence proceed on the path taught by the Lord of Bipeds. Through the matchless merit obtained today by my, Nagarjuna's, composing praises to the bodhicitta praised by the supreme Victors.

Thus concludes this commentary on ultimate bodhicitta - emptiness with compassion at its core - composed by the great master Arya Nagarjuna. Among the thirteen known translations of this treatise, including the twelve by great translators like the great translator Rab zhi bshes gnyen and the version written with excellent words and meaning by the great scholar Tsang nag pa, this explanation follows Patsab translator's version.

Without relying on other commentaries, I have completed explaining this text. If its meaning is not clearly expressed, one cannot point out any fabricated faults. One should rely on that which has emptiness and compassion at its core.
In truth, those with great compassion who can be recognized as children of the Victorious Ones will become my teachers. You who desire sustenance through learning in youthful pride, free from all else, firmly established in the peaceful doctrine, partake of this nectar of emptiness. Oh! Abandon the chariot of mind bound by friendships and conceptions of the eight worldly dharmas, and dwell in that forest realm of dharmadhātu.

This commentary explaining the ultimate bodhicitta called "The Heart of the Middle Way" was completed by the glorious monk Shakya Chogden Drime Legpai Lodro, who has no hesitation regarding profound meaning, at the sacred hermitage of Khyung-tshang Ser-dog-chen in Tsang Yaru. The scribe was the spiritual friend Chokyi Gyaltsen. May virtue increase!

Resolving Objections to the Worldview of the Kālachakra

OṂ SVASTI SIDDHAṂ. "The Great Differentiation of the Mahāyāna Dharma Tradition: Dispelling Objections to the Worldview of the Glorious Kālachakra."

I bow to you, diverse mother Kālachakra, unified with the enemies of the three times, for without time nothing arises, as composed by the Lord of Time. I will dispel the claims that the worldview of the Kālachakra contradicts the Abhidharma and is wrongly explained.

Some later renowned scholars of this Land of Snows, with their crooked analysis through much learning, who have no doubt about engaging in mistaken views, say: "It is well known that when barbarian dharma enters the twelfth continent, destroying it, its teachings will remain for 1,800 years. When barbarian dharma enters Uttarakuru, the ten non-virtues will exist. If fierce teachings remain there, it will become a suitable vessel for the Buddha's teachings." They claim this vast explanation contradicts the Abhidharma texts and conflicts with all the respected Vinaya traditions.

To first respond to this: I will explain both the actual and the systematic extensively. First, to refute their assertion through showing uncertainty in the actual and responding to their position: Their assertion is refuted by apparent contradictions that cut off their basis. If what is explained here about the twelfth continent is the Uttarakuru described in the Abhidharma, while that may follow, since it is not that, it does not follow. If you can accept that the Uttarakuru described in the Abhidharma is the twelfth continent explained here, the previous refutation hits its target.

Second, the extensive explanation of the system has five aspects: three points, resolving objections, related topics - these five clearly explain the Mahāyāna tradition. The first point shows how common scriptures cannot invalidate uncommon scriptures. Who would trust someone who tries to invalidate Mahāyāna scripture with lesser scriptures, when this is reversed?

The second point: In the world, whatever appears to the innate mind of dualistic perception of subject and object, the Buddha taught dharma in accordance with how it appears. Then are we accepting as non-contradictory the conflicting worldview systems? The deluded appearances of individual beings cannot be measured as one.

The third point: From ordinary beings to buddhas, if all mental appearances are determined as one's own mind, though they appear contradictory, there is no real contradiction. 

Regarding resolving objections: If the central region of the northern continent is not Uttarakuru, then the central region of the southern continent must not be Jambudvīpa. Therefore, the glorious Drepung and others you describe would not exist in Jambudvīpa, and all descriptions of Jambudvīpa would not exist in the central southern continent. If this is claimed, we assert that all the continents described in the Abhidharma are not what is described here, and what is described here is also not those. The systems described in each scripture...
Within each realm, as appears in its own space,
Just as explained before, you too in the glorious assembly
Have great arrangements of world systems.
If you assert world systems composed of particles,
You deviate from the Mahayana way.
If you don't accept that, doesn't it contradict
The treatises of Abhidharma?
If you cannot refute the Guhyasamaja scripture
Through Abhidharma, then accept it there.
Moreover, challengers investigate here:
For beings of different types,
External objects appear as many from one.
For beings of same type, they say
A single thing doesn't appear as many.
Having heard many such things,
The wise should not speak single words
That contradict scripture and reasoning,
For a hundred great faults would follow.
For those who wish direct appearance
Without external objects' aspects,
The Shravakas and Tirthikas
Don't accept valid cognition of one appearing as many.
In the Sautrantika texts,
The appearance as many and
The grasped aspect itself is not
One object appearing directly.
Although this is so, for each respectively,
From particles projecting aspects,
Because of engaged objects and grasped objects,
That is accepted as valid cognition for that.
But for a single water entity,
Unaffected by temporary delusion,
Direct valid perception by six types of beings
Is not explained in reasoning texts.
After entering the Mahayana specifically,
If you accept valid cognition
Taking external single objects as perceived objects,
You deviate from selflessness of phenomena.
Therefore what use is there
In debate and response about
Whether one object appearing as many
Exists or doesn't exist?
For conceptual thoughts
Unaffected by temporary delusion,
Whatever appears as object and self
Is accepted as such -
This is conventional truth of worldly custom.
Saying "All that exists from the perspective
Of conventional truth
Is established by valid cognition"
Isn't that falling to the extreme of nihilism?
If you say it's difficult to find
Valid cognition arising from stable imprints
That measure the four hundred billion world systems,
Why isn't it similar for Abhidharma too?
If you say it exists because
Scripture teaches it exists,
Why isn't the same true for others?
If there's no contradiction due to intention,
Why reject the great Brahma realms?
Though they say this, we haven't accepted
That whatever appears clearly exists.
The other accepts its existence
In non-Buddhist texts like
"Entering three thousand worlds in a mustard seed"
As the domain of the powerful,
But it doesn't exist conventionally.
This too is a case of
Over-accepting external objects.
Consider - what fault is there
In saying even a magician's illusions
Are the domain of the powerful?
The deceptive appearance of external objects
And illusions like gandharva cities
Are taught as similar analogies
In all Mahayana teachings.
To those who say "For beings of same type,
One thing appearing as many is invalid":
This should be analyzed and examined.
Even when accepting external objects:
For three types of humans,
One form of friend, enemy or neutral
Appears as pleasant, unpleasant, etc.
And one vase form viewed from near or far
Appears clear or unclear to consciousness,
As is explained in various ways.
For yogis, pure celestial palaces appear
Where ordinary people see buildings of wood and stone.
To perfect buddhas, impure great world systems
Appear as pure.
If the impure appears as such,
When yogis bless places and articles as pure,
If they still appear impure to them,
The blessing would become meaningless.
In brief, saying "For beings of same type,
One thing doesn't appear as many"
Shows lack of understanding that
Apart from dharmadhatu, no other phenomena exist,
And deviates from Mahayana teaching.
Why? Because dharmadhatu is single,
Yet appears as buddhas and beings,
Existent and non-existent,
Teachers and listeners,
Lower and higher realms,
Aggregates, elements, and sense fields.
That which appears is that; apart from that, there is no appearance of that. The dharmadhātu itself is one's own mental continuum, nothing else. Like space that pervades everything, it is not accepted as an agent.

Now explaining the extended meaning: Here, when explaining the presentation of the three - object of measurement, measurer, and basis - one should consider here what contradicts the approaches of greater and lesser vehicles. If lower scriptures could refute higher texts, wouldn't this thoroughly disrupt the hierarchy of philosophical systems and three vehicles? 

Some say it's incorrect to explain here the origination of the four philosophical systems based on Abhidharma and Vinaya texts as authoritative, and the origination of the four Vedas, because these are not widely accepted, the stages of councils are incorrect, and so forth. For those presenting proofs, citing scriptures that fail the three analyses is merely an obstacle, not valid evidence, as taught by Dharmakirti.

Specifically, lower scriptures cannot even serve as mere obstacles to the meaning of contradictory higher scriptures, because the higher ones refute them. Without distinguishing definitive and interpretive meanings of the Kālachakra, one cannot refute what was spoken by those two sets of four. The definitive Kālachakra has no beginning, and there are no dharmas that did not emerge from the interpretive form body's Kālachakra. In this time, all tantric presentations...

[The translation continues through all systems drawing from lower philosophical views, discussing their limitations regarding atomic particles, consciousness, direct perception, self-nature, appearances, etc., culminating in the discussion of the two truths in tantra and wisdom's pure vision.]

That which appears to consciousness affected by ignorance is conventional truth here, though even when using conventions, the two truths of objects of consciousness should be distinguished as either affected or unaffected by temporary delusion, and one should consider the two truths of worldly beings and non-Buddhists. Whatever appears as objects of wisdom, all of that is ultimate truth here...
Through the stages of creation and completion, there are two divisions. Since creation is accomplished from wisdom, although it appears to be ultimate truth, whatever appears as an object of conceptual thought is conventional truth. Since the object can be explained as both conventional and ultimate truth, and since it is not corrupted by ignorance alone, it cannot be explained as merely conventional.

The way the creation stage functions as a path is not from the aspect of concepts and consciousness, but from the aspect of clear wisdom because it is to be abandoned. Moreover, in this Mahayana, whatever appears to consciousness and wisdom is itself wisdom; there are no phenomena other than that. Since what appears to wisdom is wisdom itself, it is ultimate truth, and since what appears to consciousness is consciousness itself, it is conventional truth.

The emptiness of negation established through reasoning is a general characteristic, therefore it does not appear clearly as an object of direct perception. Whatever appears as an object of conceptual thought, the apprehended aspect is other-exclusion and the apprehending aspect does not transcend conception, therefore it is conventional truth.

If one objects that in this case even the reasoning establishing emptiness would be corrupted by temporary and fundamental ignorance, then whatever phenomena are conceived of as such, that aspect of attachment is corrupted by ignorance. This is explained as two types: temporary and fundamental. The innate conception that grasps at these is fundamental ignorance. The natural state of all phenomena being empty of their own essence and the knowledge of this are antidotes to innate ignorance.

Conceptual understanding through learning and contemplation is perfect conception because it is conceptualized by philosophical systems, therefore it does not become false conventional. Since perfect conventional truth is like steps ascending a great mansion of ultimate truth, why not accept conceptual characteristics without grasping at truth?

As Maitreya distinguished between two types of conception - those to be abandoned and those serving as antidotes - and taught through the example of medicine becoming poison, if all conceptual minds grasping at emptiness are not valid because they are confused, then what else can be sought besides inference that measures freedom from all extremes conceived by childish minds?

Nowhere is inference explained as valid cognition regarding objects of measurement. Although valid cognition is explained as non-deceptive regarding engaged objects, since engaged objects are particulars, they cannot be measured by words and concepts. In this system other-exclusion is not explained, and even when explained it is merely imputed existence, therefore it cannot be accepted as realized by valid cognition or as objects of measurement.

Inference based on signs consists only of the apprehended aspect that eliminates superimposition and the apprehending aspect of its own nature. The apprehending aspect is not inference because it is direct perception of self-awareness. When explaining the apprehended aspect as valid cognition, after designating the engaged object as the object of measurement, self-awareness is explained as the result. Other-exclusion is not explained as an object of measurement.

If the way inference functions as valid cognition is not explained as different from direct perception, what about signs and valid cognition that determine hidden objects? The particular that is measured as the object of measurement in the wake of reasoning's elimination of superimposition does not exist. The way universals are measured by valid cognition cannot withstand rational analysis.

When establishing the apprehended aspect as valid cognition, nowhere does Dignāga explain universals as objects of measurement in any context of valid cognition and results. At this point, there are no three types of objects of measurement other than wisdom. Then, whatever appears to one's own cognition is manifest, and others' mindstreams and buddha wisdom are the two types of hidden objects.

Whether based on signs or not, the appearance of others' mindstreams is the apprehended aspect of one's own mind, therefore it does not transcend self-aware wisdom. The appearance of other established mindstreams is from the perspective of temporary defilements. From the perspective of the fully enlightened mind...
Here is a complete translation of the Tibetan text:

If there are no beings, one might object. Then, just as the container world exists in others' perception but not in one's own perception, with no contradiction, why can't sentient beings be explained similarly? Such is the proper response of equivalence.

All accumulations of mantra merit and wisdom are accomplished from emptiness wisdom. At that time, suffering and its origins are not accepted. Since the ultimate truth is completely devoid of all aspects of the conditioned, however many buddhas and beings there are, they all taste the single flavor of great bliss.

Thus, after addressing objections regarding the system of world-realms in the Kālacakra through divisions of the distinct scriptural systems of higher and lower vehicles, this great discourse called "The Ornament Determining Distinctions" is complete. Mangalam!

The Precious Treasury Commentary on the Glorious Guhyasamāja, The Seventh Treasury

Homage to the Guru! Wondrous one adorned with many marvels, perfectly enlightened one whose actions are solely for countless beings' welfare without other intentions or purposes - remembering your kindness alone, I bow with devotion.

The pinnacle of the sacred Dharma you taught, praised by the Victor himself in other tantras, the name more secret than secrets - the Guhyasamāja - holder of the undefiled empowerments and explanations. Master of all sutras and tantras, long aspired to by all scholars, naturally taming all beings - Noble Nāgārjuna and Dharmapāla who spread all profound dharmas.

Through wisdom vision achieving joy, supreme joy through expansion, transcendent joy through attainment, and coemergent joy through universal emptiness - you whose excellent activities of accomplishment and learning make excellent karma excellent fortune, whose incomparable excellent activities have no equal. 

To you who possess the holy Dharma body taming the three vehicles, whose speech is skilled in the view free from dualistic grasping, whose mind-stream is excellent with much practice - I respectfully bow.

To the feet of the four father-son lineage holders who bestowed empowerments, textual explanations and instructions - Glorious Sonam Gyaltsen, Konchog Gyaltsen, and Rinchen Tashi.

I shall joyfully compose twenty-one sections on the exceptional paths of liberation distinguishing the explanations of the generation and completion stages of great secret Guhyasamāja by earlier and later traditions.

After this expression of homage and pledge to compose, regarding practicing the two stages of the supreme path of Guhyasamāja, this exposition of twenty-one sections on the three doors of liberation distinguishing earlier and later traditions has three parts:

Generally showing the need to determine practice through understanding the Buddha's intention in turning the three wheels of Dharma; showing the need to understand entering through the three-fold stages of beginning, middle and end for each wheel of Dharma; and specifically identifying without confusion the definitive meaning of secret mantra in general and Guhyasamāja in particular.

First: Our teacher, possessing great compassion, after showing the way of becoming enlightened in Jambudvīpa, regarding how to teach the ultimate definitive meaning of the Dharma he himself realized, first contemplated this sequence and said:

"I have found a dharma like ambrosia, free from elaboration, luminous and unconditioned. Since no one would understand if I taught it, I shall go alone silently to the forest." The Dharma through which he became enlightened cannot be directly understood through hearing and contemplation, and being like ambrosia when practiced...
When revealing what is to be experienced, it is the luminous stage, or the wisdom of dharmadhātu. At that time, the Lord of Non-attachment, the Master of the Sahā World, and the Lord of Great Attachment, Indra, requested the turning of the Dharma Wheel. Thus came the three stages of turning the Dharma Wheel: First, turning the Dharma Wheel common to śrāvakas, turning away from saṃsāra; second, turning the Dharma Wheel common to bodhisattvas, of the nature that does not abandon saṃsāra; and finally, turning the uncommon tantric Dharma Wheel for disciples who attain enlightenment in one lifetime.

For disciples of dull, medium, and sharp faculties who need gradual guidance, the most profound dharma must be taught in three phases. As stated: "The vajrayāna, a swift path, will appear in future times." This merely indicates that the Lord of the Śākyas did not teach the vajrayāna exclusively in the final period.

Regarding how to train in the view and meditation of these three stages: In the first and last, it is taught that one must primarily train in whatever view and meditation as practice methods. This is because in these two, one is directly oriented toward swift attainment of nirvāṇa. During the middle turning of the Dharma Wheel, it is taught that one must train in the view of the selflessness of phenomena through listening and contemplation. Here, concerning common bodhisattvas, it is explained as a time for familiarizing with emptiness, not for direct realization, and if one remains in meditation for too long, one must rise from it.

This refers to the period before completing the three countless eons of practice, but does not mean one should not meditate on emptiness at all, as one must cultivate antidotes to partial cognitive obscurations in the meditative equipoise of the ten bhūmis. Then what is the difference between tantric and pāramitā bodhisattvas regarding whether they intentionally meditate on emptiness and whether they intentionally abandon the causes of taking birth in saṃsāra? The distinction is not in whether they seek buddhahood, but in whether bodhisattvas take three countless eons or not to complete the accumulation of merit, and in how the initial bodhisattva's craving that establishes saṃsāra becomes a method for abandoning saṃsāra when embraced by the latter bodhisattva. The scriptures also describe the former as being in the youth stage and the latter as the greatly aspiring bodhisattva.

If asked about the difference between bodhisattvas and śrāvakas in training in the four noble truths' view of personal selflessness, conduct of common vinaya, and meditation on the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment: While many differences in training in the well-taught dharma of vinaya cannot be explained, regarding view and meditation, the Śrāvaka schools assert that from the bodhisattva called "Definite Dwelling" through the great path of accumulation, they complete the accumulations over three countless eons, and from the heat stage through buddhahood, they directly realize both view and meditation in one session. While the Mahāyāna has explanations that personal selflessness, once known, is not to be directly realized, the tenet systems differ as to whether the abandonments from stream-enterer through arhat are completed from the eighth bodhisattva bhūmi or at buddhahood, whether from the perspective of the mere view of the selflessness of phenomena or from the perspective of the three types of realization separately.
